    "# Week 2 - Corpus Linguistics\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we take text corpora that we have developed, spidered, scraped, and encoded, and we find and count words and simple phrases and properties of those counts (e.g., word frequency distributions). Initially, we model how to search corpora for keywords or phrases. Next, we examine the distributions of terms and phrases across a corpus, and the corelation between different words and phrase counts. In order to do this effectively, we coarsely disambiguate words based of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and normalize them through stemming and lemmatization. Next we distinguish *important* words and phrase within the corpus, and image them with Wordls! Then we calculate word frequenceis, conditional frequences (the frequency of word *shock* conditional on the presence of word *awe*), and statistically significant collocations of lengths 2 through $n$. Finally, we calculate and visualize Differences (Divergences and Distances) between the word frequency distributions from two corpora. \n",

    "This shows that likelihood of a word occurring is inversely proportional to its rank. This effect is called [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), and suggests that the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. Zipf's law is most easily observed by plotting the data on a log-log graph, with the axes being log (rank order) and log (frequency) resulting in a linear relationship."

      "   Whitehouse met Lila two weeks ago. She was diagnosed two years ago with osteosarcoma, a cancerous bone condition, and last year underwent cadaver bone transplant surgery. The procedure saved her leg and is helping her remain cancer-free, but the transplanted tissue will not grow with her and likely will break down over time. Stem cell research, Whitehouse explained, could vastly improve the care of patients like Lila by allowing surgeons to enhance transplants with a patient's own stem cells, which could replace the lost bone and cartilage, or grow entirely new replacement bones and joints. \n",

While it's better than `.split(' ')`, a general python string method that splits on whitespace, it is not perfect. There are many different ways to tokenize a string. `word_tokenize` is unfortunately unaware of sentences and is essentially a complicated regular expression (regex) run across the string.\n",

We can also normalize our words by lemmatizing them, or matching word variants or inflected forms to a common morpheme in a dictionary like [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu) through intelligent stemming rules. (The WordNet function `morphy` returns the given word if it cannot be matched to a word in the dictionary).\n",

The [`ConditionalFreqDist`](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html#nltk.probability.ConditionalProbDist) class reads in an iterable of tuples, the first element is the condition and the second the focal word. For starters, we will use word lengths as the conditions, but tags or clusters will provide more useful results."

    "There are few things we can learn from this word cloud:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Most of the important nouns in the book 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' are the name of the characters. Except for 'Harry', other words includes 'Ron','Hermione','Hagrid','Snape', 'Malfoy' and 'Nevil'. This feature is consistent with the theme of Harry Potter series, which focuses on the life trajectory of Harry and his friends. It's interesting that all the characters from Gryffindor are written in their first names (e.g. Ron,Nevil, Hagrid), while the ones from Slytherin are called in their last names (e.g. Snape, Malfoy). So even without the story plots, we can know that JK Rowling tried to build Gryffindor as the good side and Slytherin as the villain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Most of the important verbs in this book, including 'look','go','got','know','think','say','come','want', are words that represent for positive action. This reveals that as the first book of HP series, what Harry experienced are basically good and new things, like knowing new people, learing magic and experiencing adventures. Also, verbs with high frequency are all very easy English word, which make JK Rowling's book easy to read and follow."

    "### Interpretations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these findings about idomatic collocations, I can make some interpretations about the linguistic and cultural implications of JK Rowling's first Harry Potter book.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Among all the collocations I found, some of them are “magical terminology“, which created by JK Rowling and only can be seen in the HP series, like 'Nimbus two thousand' and 'his wand'. This reveals a remarable feature of HP series that it creates a magical world with its distinct world view, full of fantasy and imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) A large amount of collocations are the name of characters or words related to main characters. Like \"Professor Maconagal\", \"uncle Vernon\", \"Harry told Hagrid\". More importantly, the most frequent significant bigram is \"said Harry\", while a lot of other collocation also related to Harry. This feature shows that this is a book with a definite focus on the story of the main character - Harry Potter, rather than some other fantasy fiction like The Lord of the Ring, which has a more dispersed story structure. \n",

    "3) The collocation of \"said + name of character\" is very common in the book, which shows the author's preference of using dialogue or conversation to develop the story. Also, the large amount of dialogues also makes JK Rowling's book pretty readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) There also exists some funny collocations as we can see that certain characters are tend to co-occur in the book. For example, \"Fred and George\" / \"Harry, Ron, Hermoine\" & \"Malfoy, Crabb, Goyle\" are significant collocations in bigram and trigram respectively. We can understanding the author's intention on character relationships by looking into such collocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) It's worth mention that most of the high-frequency words and significant collocations are very simple vocabularies and simple collocation. A strong example is the collocations related to verbs, like \"Harry could see\", \"shook his hand\", \"Harry look\", \"he felt\". This feature makes this book very easy to read, even the reader is very young or not a native English speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) The frequency of N-grams are generally less than trigrams, while the frequency of trigrams of generally less than bigrams. This finding shows that even JK Rowling tend to use easy words in her book, the diversity of words' co-occurence and the sentences structures may not monotonous.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) In conclusion, all these findings I mentioned above contributed to a remarkable feature of the Harry Potter book -  its interestingness and readability, which can be a reason to explain why HP series is popular among teenagers in the worldwide scale."

    "### Kullback-Leibler and $x^2$ divergences ###\n",
    "\n",
    "KL and $\\chi^2$ divergences are members of the broader <a \"href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-divergence\" target=\"_blank\">$f$-divergence</a> family, a function of $D_f (P || Q)$ that calculates the difference between two probability distributions P and Q. The KL $f(t)$ is $ t \\text{ log } t $, while the $\\chi^2$ is $t^2-1$. KL comes from information and $\\chi^2$ from measure theory. As such, the KL divergence computes the relative entropy between two distributions--how they differ in bits, while the $\\chi^2$ whether the same statistical inferences can be drawn from them both.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, given two discrete probability distributions $P$ and $Q$, the Kullback-Leibler divergence from $Q$ to $P$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q) = \\sum_i P(i) \\, \\log\\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [scipy.stats.entropy()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.entropy.html) function does the calculation for you, which takes in two arrays of probabilities and computes the KL divergence. Note that the KL divergence is in general not commutative, i.e. $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q) \\neq D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q\\|P)$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the KL divernce is the sum of elementwise divergences. Scipy provides [scipy.special.kl_div()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.kl_div.html#scipy-special-kl-div) which calculates elementwise divergences for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\chi^2$ Divergence is defined as:\n",

    "The two-sample Kolmogovorov-Smirnov test statistic calculates the distance between the cumulative distribution function of the two distributions to be compared, and, along with the $x^2$ divergence, is among the most common approaches two calculating a distance in statistics. It can be interpreted as a test of whether two distributions are drawn from the same underlying distribution. As with the others, the code is readily available in scipy.\n",

    "### Wasserstein Distance ###\n",
    "\n",
    "When this is computed on a Euclidian metric structure (e.g., numbers of words), this is also known as the earth mover’s distance, because it can be seen as the minimum amount of \"work\" required to transform $P$ into $Q$, where \"work\" is measured as the amount of distribution weight that must be moved, multiplied by the distance it has to be moved.\n",

    "Now we will calculate the KL divergence for each pair of corpora, turn the results into a matrix, and visualize the matrix as a heatmap. Recall that $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q)$ measures the amount of information loss when $Q$ is used to approximate $P$. Here, the rows are the $P$s used for calculating KL divergences, and the columns are the $Q$s. So, each cell measures the amount of information loss when the word distribution of the column text is used to approximate the word distribution of the row text. Because the KL divergence is directional, such that the divergence of $P$ from $Q$ is different from the same of $Q$ from $P$, the matrix is assymetric and contains unique information above and below the diagonal. The same is true for the $\\chi^2$ divergence."

They are: a) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which is the fourth book of HP series, written by JK Rowling, b)Harry Potter and the Hald Blood Prince, which is the sixth book of HP series, written by JK Rowling, and c)Draco Dormiens, which is a fanfiction of HP series, written by a book fan. What I want to do in this part is to see if the content and linguisic features changed among the HP series, since the plots of Harry Potter were getting darker and more sophisticated. Moreover, I also want to check the fanfictions, which written by HP lovers, are different from the original HP books in wrting styles."
