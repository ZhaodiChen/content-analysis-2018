WHITEHOUSE SHARES WESTERLY GIRL'S STORY IN PUSH FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH
  Sharing the story of Lila Barber, a 12 year old girl from Westerly, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Tuesday, April 10, 2007, illustrated the hope stem cell research can offer in a speech on the Senate floor in favor of legislation to expand federal funding for stem cell research.  
   Whitehouse met Lila two weeks ago. She was diagnosed two years ago with osteosarcoma, a cancerous bone condition, and last year underwent cadaver bone transplant surgery. The procedure saved her leg and is helping her remain cancer-free, but the transplanted tissue will not grow with her and likely will break down over time. Stem cell research, Whitehouse explained, could vastly improve the care of patients like Lila by allowing surgeons to enhance transplants with a patient's own stem cells, which could replace the lost bone and cartilage, or grow entirely new replacement bones and joints. 
   ""Stem cell research gives hope to Lila and millions of Americans challenged by osteosarcoma, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, stroke, and a myriad of diseases and conditions this research might help or even cure,"" Whitehouse said. 
   Whitehouse also praised the efforts of Rhode Island Congressman Jim Langevin (D), a champion of stem cell legislation nationally and in Rhode Island, as well as Rhode Island Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Roberts. Roberts today released a statewide report on stem cells, a first step toward developing a comprehensive plan for research initiatives in Rhode Island. 
   The Stem Cell Enhancement Act (S. 5) expands the number of human embryonic stem cells eligible for federally-funded research beyond the arbitrary limits imposed by President Bush in August 2001. The bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct research on stem cells derived from embryos currently stored in fertility clinics that would otherwise be destroyed. 
   Last year, 63 senators voted to pass the Stem Cell Enhancement Act (H.R. 810), legislation similar to S. 5. President Bush issued the first veto of his presidency to block the bipartisan measure.

WHITEHOUSE SAYS PRESIDENT BUSH MUST BEGIN BRINGING TROOPS HOME FROM IRAQ
  President Bush's refusal to say when American troops will come home from Iraq leaves America less safe and adds to the already-immense burdens facing service members and their families, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said today. 
   Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence who traveled to Iraq a year ago, reiterated his belief that an announcement that the United States plans to redeploy its forces is the strongest weapon at our disposal to bring about political progress in Iraq:
   ""It's time for President Bush to listen to the American people and take action to bring our troops home from Iraq. Today, again, the President made clear that he has no intention of doing that.
   ""Iraq is embroiled in a sectarian civil war. It's clear the violence will not stop until the Iraqis take responsibility for the security and governance of their nation. To hasten that day of reconciliation, America can do one thing and one thing only: we must announce that we will redeploy our troops.
   ""Instead, President Bush has chosen to leave our servicemen and women in harm's way indefinitely, with no assurance of when, or under what conditions, they will come home. America's military has been strained almost to the breaking point, taking a serious toll on the health and welfare of our service members and their families, and leaving us ill-prepared to face gathering threats around the world.
   ""With more than 4,000 American lives lost and hundreds of billions of American tax dollars spent, the most important question for our nation is this: when can our troops return? President Bush's refusal to answer that question fails our troops, repudiates the will of the American people, and mortgages our country's security and our future.""

WHITEHOUSE TELLS NOMINEE
  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must undertake a thorough, comprehensive review of the process by which the agency makes decisions to determine whether Bush administration officials have put political considerations above science and the law, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said today at a confirmation hearing for the nominee to be EPA's general counsel. 
   ""The fact that the courts of the United States have felt compelled to characterize the positions EPA has taken in recent litigation by referring to Humpty Dumpty and Alice in Wonderland is embarrassing both to the agency and to the American people,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the EPW Committee. ""I'm deeply concerned that this Administration appears to be making legal decisions that impact our environment and public health not on their merits or their likelihood of success, but to advance a political agenda that risks lasting harm to our country.""
   At today's confirmation hearing, the EPW Committee heard testimony from David Hill, President Bush's nominee to be General Counsel of the EPA. Whitehouse closely questioned Hill on his commitment to helping EPA regain the stature and independence it has lost during the Bush Administration.
   There have been numerous signs that the decision-making process at EPA in recent years, and particularly under current Administrator Stephen L. Johnson, has been compromised by political considerations that disregard the demands of federal law and scientific evidence. Since 2001, federal courts have reversed a significant number of EPA's rules, including decisions relating to mercury emissions, water pollution discharges, new source review, and restrictions on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks.
   In New York v. EPA, decided in 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said EPA's legal argument supporting its decision to weaken new source review requirements belonged ""in a Humpty Dumpty world."" In New Jersey v. EPA, decided two years later, the same court said EPA's position employs ""the logic of the Queen of Hearts."" Hill acknowledged during today's hearing that he had reviewed those cases.
   Yesterday, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-CA) subpoenaed Administrator Johnson for the third time this year to compel the release of documents related to the EPA's denial of a request by California, Rhode Island, and other states to set strict limits on greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles. Documents reviewed by staff members of the EPW Committee showed that EPA's professional staff pushed Johnson to approve the California waiver, and demonstrated concerns among EPA staff that a denial of the waiver request would not survive a challenge in court. The documents also showed that Johnson consulted with White House officials on the waiver issue.
   On January 2, 2008, California, Rhode Island, and several other states and environmental organizations sued EPA to overturn Johnson's decision. The suit is now pending in the D.C. Circuit Court.

The agency said the company's application to dredge 230,000 cubic yards of sediment from the federal navigational channel in Mount Hope Bay was ""incomplete and insufficient."" 
   ""This news is a positive development for opponents of this proposal, and I hope the Army Corps of Engineers draws on DEM's work as the Corps makes its own permitting decisions,"" said Reed.
   ""DEM's decision recognizes the significant risks LNG tanker traffic would pose to the ecological health of Narragansett Bay and the safety of surrounding communities,"" Whitehouse said. ""I'm committed to doing all I can to help stop this facility.""

WHITEHOUSE COMMENTS ON ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S IRAQ SURGE
  A year after President Bush's speech to the nation announcing that he would significantly increase U.S. troop levels in Iraq, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) criticized the administration's continued failure to change course and begin bringing our troops home: 
  ""In 2006, the American people sent a clear message to Washington that it was time to seek a new direction in Iraq. Instead, a year ago today President Bush escalated the war, sending tens of thousands more troops into harm's way with assurances that the leaders of Iraq would step forward and work towards political reconciliation. Today, one year later, our troops have performed their duties as directed with skill and bravery - but the Iraqis have not done their part, and the Bush administration has not in its own conduct measured up to their sacrifice. 
  ""Iraq will never stand up until we prepare to stand down. I have told President Bush personally that the prospect of an American redeployment is our best pressure on Iraqi leaders to take responsibility for the security and governance of their country. America cannot continue pouring billions of dollars and thousands of lives and limbs into the sands and marshes of Iraq. The Bush Administration cannot shirk the tough choices it must make. We must announce the process of bringing our troops home.""

   Ms. Cummings, a member of the National Honor Society, is a Student Council member at East Providence High School. She is also the editor of the school newspaper and participates in the French Club and the Drug Intervention Community Educators. Miranda plans to attend Providence College and major in social work.
   Mr. Thibodeau is the class president at LaSalle Academy. He is also an academic tutor, student council representative, and newspaper reporter, and he works as a page in the Rhode Island State Senate. At LaSalle, he is a member of the Academic Decathlon Team, New England Math and Calculus League, National Italian Honor Society, and Academic Honor Society. He plans to major in chemistry.
   The Senate Youth Program was created in 1962. The program is sponsored by the Senate and has been fully funded by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation since its inception. Each year, 104 students are selected on the basis of merit (two from each state, the District of Columbia and the Department of Defense Education Activity) to participate in USSYP's week-long, intensive study of the federal government, aimed at fostering a greater understanding of the political process and a strong commitment to public service.

  ""It's time to send a clear signal to Iraq and the rest of the world that we are bringing our troops home. We're facing a simple question: is it in our country's best interests for our troops to remain in Iraq? From everything I've seen and heard, the answer is no - and for that reason, it's time to begin a rapid, responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq.
  ""In today's report by General Petraeus, the Bush administration argues that security in Iraq is improving - but with 160,000 American troops on the ground and more than $700 billion spent, we should expect some progress of some kind. What has not improved is the political environment necessary for Iraq to begin to stabilize and move forward. Nothing fundamental will change in Iraq unless its leaders have the will to work together.
  ""Our troops need to come home. Then, we can return our focus to issues here at home - from better health care to more affordable education to renewable sources of energy - that will challenge our nation's strength and security for years to come, and where we are losing ground because of this war.""

WHITEHOUSE URGES BUSH FOR NEW DIRECTION IN IRAQ
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) met with President Bush on Wednesday, April 11, to share firsthand the concerns of thousands of Rhode Islanders who believe we need a change of course in Iraq. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse recently traveled to Iraq as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.  
   ""Rhode Islanders, and people throughout the country, have sent a clear message to this administration: it's time for a new direction in Iraq,"" Whitehouse said. ""Today, I had the chance to deliver that message to the President in person. I told him that we want to bring our troops home, and urged him to consider that the strongest force he has at his disposal for a resolution in Iraq is to announce a redeployment and a change of course."" 
   Whitehouse also gave President Bush several letters sent to him by Rhode Islanders concerned about the Bush administration's misguided policy in Iraq. 
   A Cumberland woman whose nephew is serving in Iraq wrote to the President: ""I am proud to be an American! Please, please on behalf of my family and the families of all US troops - bring them home now!"" 
   A woman from Harrisville wrote as her family member was waiting to be deployed: ""Our enemies want us to be mired in a pointless war, wasting our resources and our young people. They want us hurting. Withdrawing from Iraq is the smart thing to do, and that is what our enemies fear most."" 
   A Johnston man whose son is serving in Iraq wrote: ""We the majority of the American people oppose this war and the escalation of troops, even our Generals both active and retired say the escalation of our troops will not help. It is time to bring our men home!"" 
   Several members of Congress were invited to meet with the President following recent official visits to Iraq. Whitehouse traveled there in mid-March on an official congressional delegation visit to meet with American troops and assess the situation on the ground. While in country, he talked with American military commanders, including General David Petraeus, as well as several high-ranking Iraqi officials and members of the U.S. embassy and intelligence staffs. Whitehouse also spoke with Marines from Rhode Island now serving in Fallujah. 
   Whitehouse joined a majority of the Senate to pass war funding legislation that would compel President Bush to begin redeploying American troops from Iraq within four months, with a goal of having all combat troops out of the country by March 31, 2008. Whitehouse also is a cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) and supported by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) that will limit funding for the war after April 2008 to counter-terrorism, training, and force protection.

   Eng. Jose Socrates Sousa 
  Primeiro Ministro 
  Rue de Imprensa a Estrela 4 
  1200-888 Lisboa PORTUGAL 
   Dear Mr. Prime Minister: 
   We write regarding the potential closing of the Portuguese consulate in Rhode Island. 
   As United States Senators, we fully understand the financial pressures which require your decision to cut back on some foreign consulates. However, we would like to highlight the invaluable services the Providence consulate provides to the thousands of citizens of Portuguese descent in New England and how the consulate strengthens the bond between our two nations. 
   The Portuguese consulate in Providence has proved critical in informing residents of the state and the nation about Portugal's policies and concerns and its view of U.S. policy. The consulate offers regular communication with official representatives of the Portuguese government and enhances the ability of the Portuguese American citizens of Rhode Island to act together on behalf of these concerns. We and our staffs, as well as our constituents, have also found it useful to work with consular officials on a whole range of subjects. 
   The Portuguese American citizens of Rhode Island are dedicated, loyal Americans who contribute to our economy, while they continue to be proud of their Portuguese heritage, which is celebrated so vibrantly in Rhode Island. They rely on the Consulate for innumerable services. Many have contacted me to express their great concern about the potential loss of this valuable resource. While there is consular service in Boston, it is not necessarily easy for those in my state who are in need of consular services to travel there. In addition, the Providence Consulate has proved extremely valuable to my office, including on immigration issues. With Congress poised to consider potential changes in the U.S. immigration system, we foresee even more utilization of the consulate in the future. There is no substitute, even in the day of modern communications, for easy direct personal access among people who share important official concerns. 
   We understand this is a difficult decision that you must make together with your colleagues. However, we hope you will consider all that the Providence consulate provides to the state of Rhode Island and a significant Portuguese-American population. 
   Please feel free to contact us with any questions you may have, and thank you for your consideration. 
   Sincerely, 
   Jack Reed

  President Bush's irresponsible fiscal policies have cost America a staggering $7.7 trillion, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said today in remarks delivered on the Senate floor during debate on the Senate's budget resolution. Whitehouse said that the ""Bush Debt,"" a comprehensive account of the impact of surpluses squandered and new debt accumulated over the seven years under President Bush, demonstrates the need for new priorities and fiscal discipline as Congress considers the last budget resolution it will pass under the Bush presidency. 
   ""Instead of keeping our nation on the path to economic security and prosperity, to new investments in our health care system, our students, our seniors, and our veterans, the President who called for 'responsibility' squandered away the surpluses he inherited, mortgaged our children and grandchildren's futures, and compromised the quality of working Americans' lives,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Budget Committee. ""This President will leave behind millions of Americans who, had this Administration merely stayed the course of fiscal responsibility charted by President Clinton, would be far better off than they are today.""
   The ""Bush Debt"" was derived from a calculation of the difference between projections of the nation's fiscal outlook had policies in place under President Clinton been allowed to continue, and the reality under President Bush today. Whitehouse found that Bush's misguided policies, from the war in Iraq to tax breaks for the wealthy, have cost America $7.7 trillion in foregone surpluses and new debt.
   The President's budget for fiscal year 2009 also includes $260 billion in interest payments on the debt next year alone, or $857 for every woman, man, and child in the United States. These massive interest payments take away federal funds that could otherwise be used to benefit the American people. If that $260 billion were available to be spent for other purposes, Whitehouse said, we could provide health insurance to every uninsured American, double the maximum Pell Grant award, cover all remaining children eligible for Head Start, and fix virtually all the nation's bridges in need of repair.
   This week, the Senate is debating a budget resolution that would chart a very different course. This proposal, passed Thursday by the Senate Budget Committee, increases funding for veterans, schools, and transportation infrastructure and provides for a second economic stimulus package to help working families facing continued financial hardship. It would also lower taxes for the middle class and create jobs.

WHITEHOUSE BACKS SENATE EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN HATE CRIME STATUTE
  Citing the need to give local law enforcement stronger tools to prosecute hate crimes, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Thursday, April 12, added his support to new legislation that will include sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and disability status as part of the federal hate crimes statute.  
   ""Crimes of hate are unacceptable and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" said Whitehouse. ""I'm proud to support legislation that aims to end these crimes of bias forever."" 
   Currently, only 27 states and Washington, D.C. classify gender-based crimes as hate crimes; 31 states and Washington, D.C. include sexual-orientation based crimes; and only 31 states and Washington, D.C. include disability-based crimes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has documented more than 114,000 hate crimes since 1991. 
   The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crime Prevention Act of 2007, introduced today by Senators Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.), will give local law enforcement officials important tools, like training or direct assistance, to combat crimes that show evidence of prejudice based on sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability status. 
   The bill also would encourage Americans to report hate crimes, through increased public education and awareness, and would allow local prosecutors to pursue bias-motivated crime under federal law in areas in which state statutes are inadequate. 
   A similar version of the measure, which had broad, bipartisan support, was passed by both the House and Senate in the 109th Congress, but was scuttled in a conference committee and ultimately did not become law.

WHITEHOUSE MEASURE SAFEGUARDING PRIVACY AGAINST GOVERNMENT SPYING
  During its consideration of reforms to a federal law that sets restrictions on when the government can spy on Americans, the U.S. Senate today passed an amendment sponsored by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) that significantly strengthens judicial oversight and safeguards the privacy rights of innocent Americans who are not targeted for surveillance.  
  ""The Bush administration unilaterally assumed extraordinary authority to tap Americans' phones and to invade Americans' privacy - with seemingly no regard for individual rights,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""We need to assure that rules protecting Americans' rights are being followed, and because this administration fears and rejects judicial oversight, that is precisely what is most needed.""
  In 2005, the New York Times reported on a Bush administration program to wiretap electronic communications by Americans inside the country without first obtaining warrants, in an apparent attempt to sidestep the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978, which sets strict limits on domestic government spying. In August of last year, under pressure from the administration to revise the existing law, Congress passed the Protect America Act (P.L. 110-55), which authorized expanded surveillance, but did not authorize the court that oversees the FISA program to ensure that any privacy protections were being implemented.
  The Senate is now considering new legislation to repair the problems of the Protect America Act, an effort in which Whitehouse has been deeply involved. Whitehouse's amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Amendments Act of 2007 (S. 2248) focuses on protections for Americans who are not the target of surveillance, but whose information or conversations may be incidentally intercepted during surveillance of a targeted person. In domestic law enforcement, there are clear, established procedures for ""minimizing"" the collection or retention of this information, to ensure that the privacy of innocent Americans is protected, and the prospect of judicial review is an important part of this protection. 
  S. 2248 gives the FISA Court the authority to approve minimization procedures, but says nothing about the Court's corresponding inherent authority, common to all courts, to review whether the procedures it has approved are being followed, and to order compliance. The Whitehouse amendment would repair that flaw by making clear that nothing in S. 2248 reduces or contravenes the FISA Court's inherent authority to enforce compliance with the Court-approved minimization procedures. 
  ""As a former U.S. attorney and Rhode Island attorney general who oversaw wiretaps and other surveillance procedures, I've seen that law enforcement officials are more likely to follow the rules when there is a strong prospect of judicial oversight,"" Whitehouse said. ""It makes no sense to limit the court's inherent authority to see whether rules it has approved are being followed, and to enforce compliance with these approved rules. It is not up to the executive branch to grade its own exams. That is a job for the courts.""

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) joined U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in a letter to two Justice Department watchdog offices today to request an investigation into the role of Justice Department officials in authorizing and/or overseeing the use of waterboarding by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Both senators are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
  ""Despite the virtually unanimous consensus of legal scholars and the overwhelming weight of legal precedent that waterboarding is illegal, certain Justice Department officials, operating behind a veil of secrecy, concluded that the use of waterboarding is lawful,"" the senators wrote. ""The Justice Department's continued refusal to repudiate waterboarding does tremendous damage to America's values and image in the world and places Americans at risk of being subjected to waterboarding by enemy forces. We believe it merits investigation to determine if these grievous results were the product of legal theories violating the Department's professional standards, or improper influence violating the Department's standards for independent legal advice."" 
  Last year, Whitehouse asked Judge Michael B. Mukasey, then the Bush administration's nominee to be Attorney General, whether the practice of waterboarding is torture or is constitutional. Mukasey's failure to state definitively that waterboarding is torture led Whitehouse to vote against his nomination, and Whitehouse has since joined a series of efforts by Senator Durbin and other Judiciary Committee Democrats to press the Attorney General to reassess its conclusion that the practice is legal. In a hearing last week before the Senate Intelligence Committee, of which Whitehouse is a member, General Michael Hayden, director of the CIA, publicly acknowledged for the first time that the U.S. government had used waterboarding during interrogations of several detainees, including Khalid Sheik Mohammed.

   Dear Inspector General Fine and Counsel Jarrett:
  We request that you investigate the role of Justice Department officials in authorizing and/or overseeing the use of waterboarding by the Central Intelligence Agency.
   Attorney General Michael Mukasey refuses to investigate the Administration's authorization and use of waterboarding. CIA Director Michael Hayden has testified that the CIA waterboarded three detainees, and Attorney General Mukasey has testified that, ""There are circumstances where waterboarding is clearly unlawful."" Nonetheless, the Attorney General refused Senator Durbin's request to investigate because he does ""not believe such an investigation is necessary, appropriate, or legally sustainable."" 
   Attorney General Mukasey admitted that, ""the CIA sought advice from the Department of Justice, and the Department informed the CIA that [waterboarding's] use would be lawful under the circumstances and within the limits and the safeguards of the program."" The Attorney General's justification for refusing to open an investigation is that, ""no one who relied in good faith on the Department's past advice should be subject to criminal investigation for actions taken in reliance on that advice."" However, this does not address Senator Durbin's request that ""a Justice Department investigation should explore whether waterboarding was authorized and whether those who authorized it violated the law"" (our emphasis).
   Waterboarding has a sordid history in the annals of torture by repressive regimes, from the Spanish Inquisition to the Khmer Rouge. The United States has always repudiated waterboarding as a form of torture and prosecuted it as a war crime. The Judge Advocates General, the highest-ranking attorneys in each of the four military services, have stated unequivocally that waterboarding is illegal and violates Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.
   Yet, despite the virtually unanimous consensus of legal scholars and the overwhelming weight of legal precedent that waterboarding is illegal, certain Justice Department officials, operating behind a veil of secrecy, concluded that the use of waterboarding is lawful. We believe it is appropriate for you to investigate the conduct of these Justice Department officials. As you know, a similar investigation is underway regarding Justice Department officials who advised the National Security Agency that its warrantless surveillance program is lawful.
   To restore the faith of our intelligence professionals and the American people in the Justice Department's ability to provide accurate and honest legal advice, we request that you make your findings public. 
   We ask that you explore, among other things:
   Did Justice Department officials who advised the CIA that waterboarding is lawful perform legal work that meets applicable standards of professional responsibility and internal Justice Department policies and standards? For example, did these officials consider all relevant legal precedents, including those that appear to contradict directly their conclusion that waterboarding is lawful? Did these officials consult with government attorneys who are experts in the relevant legal standards, e.g. Judge Advocates General who are experts in the Geneva Conventions? Was it reasonable to rely on standards found in areas such as health care reimbursement law in evaluating interrogation techniques? 
   Were Justice Department officials who advised the CIA that waterboarding is lawful insulated from outside pressure to reach a particular conclusion? What role did White House and/or CIA officials play in deliberations about the lawfulness of waterboarding? 
  We agree with Attorney General Mukasey that our intelligence professionals should be able to rely in good faith on the Justice Department's legal advice. However, if CIA agents or contractors have been put in jeopardy by misguided counsel from the Justice Department, including legal opinions that the Administration has been forced to repudiate, and as a result they risk war crimes prosecution overseas, this is a serious matter. It also places CIA agents at risk of receiving similarly flawed advice in the future. Moreover, the Justice Department's continued refusal to repudiate waterboarding does tremendous damage to America's values and image in the world and places Americans at risk of being subjected to waterboarding by enemy forces. We believe it merits investigation to determine if these grievous results were the product of legal theories violating the Department's professional standards, or improper influence violating the Department's standards for independent legal advice. 
  We respectfully request that you inform us whether you plan to initiate a review as soon as possible, and no later than February 19, 2008. We also request that you inform us whether the results of your review will be provided to Congress and made public. Thank you for your time and consideration.
   Sincerely,
   Richard J. Durbin 
  Sheldon Whitehouse

WHITEHOUSE: AMERICA HAS CALLED ON PRESIDENT TO BRING TROOPS HOME
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) made the following remarks on the Senate floor this morning. The following is as delivered:
   Mr. President, the American people have demanded a new direction in Iraq, and the momentum building toward that change is strong. It is not difficult to understand why. 
   More than 3,600 brave American troops have lost their lives. Tens of thousands have returned home gravely injured - gravely injured. The war now costs Americans $10 billion every month in Iraq, with total spending now exceeding that of the Vietnam war. It has ruined our international standing. 
   Despite all this, little has changed on the ground. Violence has worsened. Sectarian fighting goes on virtually unabated, with deadly attacks taking a severe and relentless toll. While courageous Americans die, Iraqi politicians argue and stall.  
   Leaving U.S. troops caught in the morass of Iraq has not made that country more secure and, more important, it does not make our country more secure. To stay President Bush's course will continue to cost our men and women in uniform their lives and their physical and mental health. It will continue to drain our national Treasury and further erode what little good will remains for America around the world. It will leave our military with overstrained troops, overstressed families, and equipment and resources in disrepair. We are breaking our military in Iraq. 
   It is time for a change. The American people know this. Democrats and, to their credit, many Republicans in this Congress know this. Anyone who is listening or looking with clear eyes knows this. Yet after years of misjudgments, years of misleading slogans, years of misplaced priorities, and years of failure, this President still refuses to do what he must do: Change course in Iraq and bring our courageous American troops home. 
   Just the other day, the President reasserted his intention to stay the course, to continue this war indefinitely, an open-ended commitment, a blank check, with no prospects for redeployment or a new direction. Again, President Bush has failed to listen to the millions of Americans who have called on him and who have called on us to bring the war to an end. Enough is enough. It is time for a change. 
   Mr. President, a Member of this body recently said this about our Nation's course in Iraq: 
   In my judgment, the costs and risks of continuing down the current path outweigh the potential benefits that might be achieved. Persisting indefinitely with the surge strategy will delay policy adjustments that have a better chance of protecting our vital interests over the long-term. 
   I happen to agree with those words spoken by the very distinguished Senator, Richard Lugar of Indiana, but what I like the most about them is the voice of reason and thoughtfulness they impart to this debate. There has been too little of that to date. The questions we face over this war in Iraq are serious questions, and they demand seriousness and reason from those who would grapple with them. Senator Lugar's statement reflects that thoughtfulness, reflects that reason, in the midst of a debate which has all too often been characterized by a lack of those characteristics. 
   Look at this administration, which too often communicates not with reason but with slogans and sound bites: ""Stay the course."" ""Global war on terror."" ""Cut and run."" ""Precipitous withdrawal."" People watching this continuing debate, mark when you hear the phrase ""precipitous withdrawal."" You are hearing the end of reason, and sloganeering. This is no service to the people of our country, not when serious and difficult problems must be solved. Just look where this slogan leadership has gotten us so far. It is a dishonor roll of failure: weapons of mass destruction, nonexistent; occupation planning, incompetence; reconstruction efforts, failed; the strain on our troops and their families, disabling; the treatment of our wounded troops, disgraceful; expenditures, massive; fraud, run rampant; the confidence of the American people, forfeited after cascades of false optimism and phony good news. 
   It is time, as Senator Lugar's words exemplify, to pursue intelligent, thoughtful, and realistic decisions about our course in Iraq, decisions that will protect our national interest. It is time to put the slogans away and thoughtfully extricate ourselves from a disastrous mess. 
   I hope we can take these steps forward in the Senate together. I am encouraged that several Republican friends have stated clearly that they cannot support the President's failed course in Iraq and are seeking real change. 
   As I have said many times in this Chamber, our strategy to effect change in Iraq requires the rapid and responsible redeployment of our troops. As I told the President directly when I met with him several months ago, I see the prospect of U.S. redeployment as the most powerful force at our disposal in this conflict now. That prospect of redeployment of American troops will eliminate the insurgents' argument that America is an occupying army, taking away from them a powerful recruiting tool for militant extremists. It will spur Iraq's political leaders to step forward, to quit slow-walking us through their own civil war and take responsibility for the security and governance of their own country. It will confront neighboring nations with a real impetus to assume more positive roles in assuring the region's stability. It will help restore the faith of the world in the leadership, the integrity, the good judgment, and the good will of our great country. 
   The President's surge plan is not the new direction Americans are calling for. It is a tactic - a tactic that can only be effective as part of a larger coherent strategy. And strategy, in turn, largely depends on whether the overarching dynamic works in America's favor. In this regard, America is presently on the worst possible footing. 
   A redeployment of our troops creates the potential to change this overarching dynamic for the better, freeing us to focus on more effective strategies to counter al-Qaida and to stabilize the region. Iraqi leaders will have to reach compromises with each other because their vision for their country's future will no longer be drawn with a major U.S. military presence in it. In the time it will take to bring our massive deployment of troops home, we can send a clear signal to Iraqi leaders and to Iraq's neighbors that America is standing down and it is time for them to stand up. We can help them do that. 
   This is a critical step, and thoughtful, reasoned, political, and diplomatic leadership will be essential to take advantage of the new dynamic a redeployment offers. I will confess that I am deeply troubled that this administration may not have the credibility it needs to accomplish this difficult task, even if it were of a mind to try. 
   This Congress can help set favorable conditions for executive action. We cannot legislate diligence, we cannot legislate thoughtfulness, we cannot legislate competence, and it is not clear that this administration is viewed as capable of those qualities any longer. It may take new faces and new voices to represent our country credibly in this process. Fortunately, there are many talented and accomplished people in this country whose perspectives and experience can help build America's credibility and prestige around the world. It will be a significant diplomatic challenge, but it presents a significant - perhaps historic - diplomatic opportunity. 
   That executive responsibility - the need to put ourselves in that diplomatic arena -- does not relieve us in the Senate of our duty to continue to press forcefully on behalf of the millions of Americans who demanded a change in Iraq, to apply reason, thought, and our best care and judgment to a problem that has not yielded to sloganeering. We will keep the pressure on this President and his administration, whose inability to admit failure is leading our precious Nation deeper and deeper into disaster in Iraq. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE: BUSH ADMINISTRATION STONEWALLING ON NEGOTIATING POWER FOR MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today sharply questioned a senior Bush administration official over the administration's opposition to negotiating for lower prescription drug prices under the Medicare Part D program.  
   Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Michael O. Leavitt appeared before the Senate Budget Committee, on which Whitehouse sits, to discuss the administration's fiscal year 2008 budget request for federal health care programs. 
   ""As seniors confront skyrocketing prescription drug costs, it's extraordinarily frustrating that the Bush administration is unwilling to pursue the obvious remedy: lower drug prices through negotiation,"" Whitehouse said. 
   A vocal advocate for health care reform, Whitehouse has repeatedly called for Medicare to have the authority to negotiate for lower drug prices. Today, he cited a January report by Families USA showing that prices for the top drugs prescribed for seniors are 58 percent higher in Medicare drug plans than when offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). While the VA is permitted to negotiate with drug companies to get the best price for their beneficiaries, Medicare is prohibited by law from negotiating for lower drug prices under the current Part D program. 
   Whitehouse has heard from many Rhode Island seniors who were confused and frustrated by problems they experienced with Medicare Part D. As of last month, 38,400 seniors in Rhode Island who are eligible for prescription drug coverage under Medicare Part D had not yet enrolled, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

WHITEHOUSE URGES SENATE TO PROHIBIT TORTURE
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse urged the Senate to pass legislation banning torture. Below are Whitehouse's remarks as delivered.
  Mr. President, today's debate goes to the heart of what our country is, and what we wish it to be. By asking this: will the United States of America condone torture? Is there, at America's heart, a heart of darkness? 
  This authorization bill for America's intelligence community, offers us the opportunity to answer that question decisively. It contains a provision for which I have fought, for my initial amendment in Committee, and which I am proud to support today, that would prohibit members of the intelligence community from using any interrogation technique beyond those authorized in the Army Field Manual.
  By adopting this amendment, the two Intelligence Committees - Congress's experts on these matters - have sent a clear signal to America and to the world: that in this country the rule of law is our strongest bulwark against those who would do us harm. I hope that today, the Senate will have the confidence in our national values to reaffirm that signal, and pass this legislation with the Army Field Manual provision included. 
  Over the past several months, the American people have become all too familiar with the issue of torture. I want to discuss one technique in particular today:
  Waterboarding - or water torture, or the water cure - which dates back to the Spanish Inquisition of the 14th century. Waterboarding was a favorite of torturers, because its' terrible effects could be generated without the visible damage accompanying the rack, the screw, the iron, the whip or the gouge. It could be done over and over and over and over. 
  In the 20th century, waterboarding was done in the Philippines, where colonizers wielded it against indigenous peoples. It's been used in Sri Lanka, in Tunisia, by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia - we are in the tradition of Pol Pot - by the French in Algeria, by the Japanese in World War II, and by military dictatorships in Latin America.
  The technique ordinarily involves strapping a captive in a reclining position, heels above head, putting a cloth over his face and pouring water over the cloth to simulate, to create, the feeling of suffocation and drowning. As I said, it leaves no marks on the body, but causes extreme physical and psychological suffering. 
  A French journalist, Henri Alleg, was subjected to this method of interrogation during the struggle for Algerian independence, and he wrote in his 1958 book The Question:
  I tried, by contracting my throat, to take in as little water as possible and to resist suffocation by keeping air in my lungs for as long as I could. But I couldn't hold on for more than a few moments. I had the impression of drowning, and a terrible agony, that of death, took possession of me.
  Waterboarding is associated with criminal, tyrant, and repressive regimes, with rulers who sought from their captives not information but propaganda, meant for broadcast to friends or enemies whether true or false. Regimes that employed the technique of waterboarding generally did not do so to obtain information - rather, to obtain compliance. But no matter the purpose or the reason, its use was, and is, indefensible. 
  Water torture was not unknown to Americans. A 1953 article in the New York Times quotes Lt. Col. William Harrison of the U.S. Air Force, who said he was ""tortured with the 'water treatment' by Communist North Koreans."" In testimony before a U.S. military tribunal, Capt. Chase Jay Nielsen described being waterboarded by his Japanese captors following the 1942 Doolittle raid by U.S. aviators. 
  From all this, America's military knew there was a chance our servicemen and servicewomen could be subjected to water torture. The Defense Department established the SERE program: Survive, Evade, Resist, and Escape, to train select military personnel, who are at high risk of capture by enemy forces or isolation within enemy territory. 
  The program has also subjected certain service personnel to extreme interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, in an effort to prepare them for the worst: the possibility of capture and torture at the hands of a depraved or tyrannical enemy. According to Malcolm Nance, a former master instructor and chief of training at the U.S. Navy SERE school in San Diego: ""[O]ur training was designed to show how an evil totalitarian enemy would use torture at the slightest whim."" 
  Those who have experienced this technique, even at the hands of their own brothers in arms, are unequivocal about its effect. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, who underwent waterboarding during SERE training, said this: ""As a human being, fear and helplessness are pretty overwhelming. ... this is not a discussion that Americans should ever be having. It is torture."" And our colleague in this body, Senator John McCain, has said the same.
  Yet it was to this relic of the dungeons of the Inquisition, of the Cambodian Killing Fields, and of the juntas of the southern hemisphere, that the Bush administration turned for guidance. I will speak later of how our Department of Justice came to approve this. But for now, we know just last week, in a stunning public admission, CIA Director General Michael Hayden admitted that the United States waterboarded three detainees following the September 11th attacks. The virus of waterboarding had traveled from tyrant regimes, through the SERE program, and infected America's body politic.
  Retired Brigadier General David Irvin of the U.S. Army Reserve, a former intelligence officer and instructor in interrogation, and Joe Navarro, an interrogator with the FBI, have recently written this:
  [T]here is considerable evidence that the CIA had to scramble after 9/11 to develop an interrogation program and turned to individuals with no professional experience in the field. ... Given the crisis atmosphere of the day, it is all too easy to believe the comment of an intelligence insider who said of the secret program to detain and interrogate al Qaeda suspects that ""quality control went out the window.""
  Don't let us jump out the window after it.
  America's military is expressly prohibited from using torture - because intelligence experts in our armed forces know that torture is an ineffective method of obtaining actionable intelligence. 
  Again I will speak later about the false assertion that this program was designed for eighteen year old novices. Some of the most sophisticated intelligence interrogations are done by our military after intense training. And, our military adheres to the Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations. At a hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on which I serve, I asked Col. Steven Kleinman, a 22-year veteran of interrogations, a senior intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force Reserves and a veteran interrogator with plenty of experience overseas in the Middle East, about his experience conducting interrogations using the Army Field Manual. He said this: 
  I am not at all limited by the Army Field Manual in terms of what I need to do to generate useful information. ... I've never felt any necessity or operational requirement to bring physical, psychological or emotional pressure on a source to win their cooperation.
  A significant number of retired military leaders have written to the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee saying:
  Interrogation methods authorized by the Field Manual have proven effective in eliciting vital intelligence from dangerous enemy prisoners. ... And the principles reflected in the Field Manual are values that no, no U.S. agency should violate.
  And General David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces serving in Iraq, reiterated this point when he wrote last year to every soldier serving in the Iraq theater:
  Some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy. They would be wrong. Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal, history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary. ...our experience in applying the interrogation standards laid out in the Army Field Manual, [section] (2-22.3) on Human Intelligence Collector Operations that was published last year shows that the techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in eliciting information from detainees.
  That is the end of General Petraeus's quote.
  The co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission emphatically agree. On Monday the chairmen, together with two former Secretaries of State, three former National Security Advisors and other national security experts, wrote that ""[c]ruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners under American control makes us less safe, violates our nation's values, and damages America's reputation in the world.""
  Torture is ineffective, it's wrong, and it's dangerous to all those who serve the United States of America in harm's way. It should never, ever be used by any person who represents the United States of America, or any agency that flies the American flag. 
  I was proud, last July, to introduce an amendment in the Intelligence Committee that would write this rule into law, and when that effort did not succeed, I was proud again, last winter, to support Senator Feinstein's amendment in conference. 
  I call on all my colleagues to support this legislation. We can journey no longer down Winston Churchill's ""stairway which leads to a dark gulf."" As Winston Churchill said, ""It is a fine broad stairway at the beginning, but after a bit the carpet ends. A little farther on there are only flagstones, and a little farther on still these break beneath your feet.""
  The United States of America - the city on a hill, the light of the world, the promise of generations - must not ever condone torture. Torture breaks that promise, torture extinguishes that light, torture darkens that city. I hope that by our actions today, we in the Senate will help turn this country back toward our centuries-old promise. I hope we will turn towards the light. 
  I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE CRITICIZES JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ADVICE CONDONING TORTURE
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse yesterday decried a decision by the Department of Justice to advise the CIA that the interrogation technique called ""waterboarding"" is legal, despite significant precedent in U.S. law showing the government had long considered the practice to be illegal.Below are Whitehouse's remarks as delivered.
   Mr. President, I want to follow the lead of the distinguished Senator from North Dakota and my friend, the Senator from Illinois, and continue on this question with the determination the Government has made that waterboarding is legal.
   It is a question that matters so much to wary and watchful nations, disheartened and distrustful in the wake of 7 years of failed leadership and broken promises. It is also a question that matters immensely to the billions of men, women, and children around the globe who look to this country, the United States of America, as a beacon of light that shows the way nations ought to act and the way the world ought to be. It is a question that matters to the American people who are sick of asking: Is it wrong? and being told: Well, it depends. 
   The people of America still do not know how this came about-in particular, how the Department of Justice came to approve this sordid technique. I believe we are in a position where the concerns we have about torture overlap with some of the concerns we have had in this Chamber about the independence and integrity of the Department of Justice. Here is what we know.
   We know that Attorney General Michael Mukasey has said that ""the CIA sought advice from the Department of Justice, and the Department informed the CIA that [waterboarding's] use would be lawful under the circumstances and within the limits and safeguards of the program."" We know in 2002, John Yoo of the Office of Legal Counsel drafted a memo, later approved by Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee, which reads, in part:
   There is a significant range of acts that, though they might constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, failed to rise to the level of torture.
   As Evan Wallach of the Columbia Journal of Transnational Law has written:
   None of the Memo's analysis explains why waterboarding does not cause physical or psychological pain sufficient to meet the criminalization standards it enunciates.
   We have asked for further clarification, but in a hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Mukasey refused to comment on the legality of waterboarding because the technique was not currently in use and because of what he described as ""the absence of concrete facts and circumstances."" Even though the Department of Justice is now conducting an investigation into whether tape recordings of alleged waterboarding sessions were improperly destroyed, they would not look into whether the conduct on the tape was in and of itself improper.
   The argument is that no one who relies in good faith on the Department's past advice should be subject to criminal investigations for actions taken in reliance on that advice, which raises the question within the question: How did that advice come to be given in the first place?
   How did the best and brightest of the Department of Justice overlook the facts of the history of waterboarding prosecutions in which the United States was directly involved, and why was such guidance approved when contravening precedents appear clearly to be in evidence?
   Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues the article written by Evan Wallach, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, entitled ""Drop by Drop: Forgetting the History of Water Torture in U.S. Courts."" The full cite is 45 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 468 (2007).
   Mr. President, the U.S. Government long considered waterboarding a form of torture, prosecutable as a war crime and punishable accordingly. This history includes war crimes prosecutions against Japanese soldiers who water boarded American aviators in World War II, the use of water torture by U.S. soldiers in the Philippines, and even an incident of waterboarding by a local sheriff prosecuted by the Department of Justice itself. Let me start with that.
   I am reading from the Wallach law review article in which it reports:
   In 1983, the Department of Justice affirmed that the use of water torture techniques was indeed criminal conduct under U.S. law.
   A sheriff in a Texas county waterboarded prisoners in order to extract confessions. Count one of the indictment asserted that the defendants conspired to-and this is a quote from the Department's own indictment - ""subject prisoners to a suffocating 'water torture' ordeal in order to coerce confessions. This generally included the placement of a towel over the nose and mouth of the prisoner and the pouring of water in the towel until the prisoner began to move, jerk, or otherwise indicate he was suffocating and/or drowning.""
   The sheriff and his deputies were all convicted by a jury under count one. It didn't end there. The case then went up on appeal, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rendered a decision. I have in my hands United States of America v. Lee, 744 F.2d 1124, decided in 1984, in which they gave appellate review of these convictions.
   Finally, at sentencing, U.S. District Judge James DeAnda's comments, according to the article, were ""He told the former Sheriff that he had allowed law enforcement to fall into 'the hands of a bunch of thugs. The operation down there would embarrass the dictator of a country.'"" That is the opinion of a U.S. district court judge at a sentencing on waterboarding.
   How is it that when the Department of Justice, the Office of Legal Counsel, were asked for their opinion, they were able to write this opinion? I have it in my hand. This is the unclassified version. It has been substantially redacted. Even so, it is 50 pages long - 50 pages long. They did 50 pages of legal research and could not find a U.S. Court of Appeals case in which the Department of Justice itself had brought the charges? Here is the case, United States v. Lee. It describes the facts:
   Lee was indicted along with two other deputies, Floyd Baker and James Glover, and the County Sheriff James Parker, based on a number of incidents in which prisoners were subjected to a ""water torture"" in order to prompt confessions to various crimes. 
  Throughout the rest of the opinion, these are referred to as ""torture"" and ""torture incidents.""
   All one has to have is Lexus or Westlaw and plug in the words ""water torture"" and find this case. How is it possible that the Office of Legal Counsel could not have found this? How is it possible that they could have also missed what the Columbia Law School was able to find - a telegram from Secretary of State Cordell Hull to the Japanese Government objecting to the mistreatment of American prisoners, which included specifically waterboarding and describing the ""brutal and bestial methods of extorting alleged confessions""? That is our Secretary of State in an official communication to the Japanese Government describing, among other tortures, water tortures as brutal and bestial methods to extort alleged confessions. How could they not have found that? How could they not have found the charges the Senator from North Dakota referred to in which Japanese soldiers were brought up on charges in front of military tribunals-military tribunals staffed with American judges, military tribunals staffed with American prosecutors - for waterboarding American prisoners?
   Here are some examples. One of the Japanese officers was named Hata and the article describes the charges and specifications against Officer Hata, which included this:
   ... Hata did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Morris O. Killough, an American Prisoner of War, by beating and kicking him, by fastening him on a stretcher and pouring water up his nostrils.
   Similarly, Hata did willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Thomas B. Armitage, William O. Cash and Monroe Dave Woodall, American Prisoners of War, by beating and kicking them, by forcing water into their mouths and noses. .....
   The charge and specifications against Officer Asano were:
   Asano did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Morris O. Killough, an American Prisoner of War, by beating and kicking him, by fastening him on a stretcher and pouring water up his nostrils. .....
   Asano did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Thomas B. Armitage, William O Cash and Munroe Dave Woodall, American Prisoners of War, by beating and kicking them, by forcing water into their mouths and noses. .....
   The charge and specifications against Officer Kita were again, ""willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture John Henry Burton, an American Prisoner of War, by beating him and by forcing water into his nose.""
   Over and over the testimony describes exactly what we know as waterboarding. The charges and specifications by this tribunal staffed by American officers describe that they did willfully and unlawfully commit cruel, inhuman, and brutal acts and atrocities and other offenses, including strapping them to a stretcher and pouring water down their nostrils, by holding the prisoner's head back and forcing him to swallow a bucketful of sea water over and over and over.
   How could they have missed it? How could they have missed it? How could they miss the decision on point by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit?
   What else do we know about the Office of Legal Counsel? We know that the conditions there were pretty ripe for abuse. We know they were doing this in secret, protected from public scrutiny, protected from peer review, protected from critical analysis under the veil of secrecy, deep secrecy in which they were operating, coming up with the theories as they pleased, thinking they would never see the light of day. So they did not have to do their homework. Somebody might have done a little research and found the Fifth Circuit decision on point, but, no, they did not need to.
   It is part of a pattern because, as the Presiding Officer will recall, when I was offered the chance to read the secret Office of Legal Counsel opinions related to the warrantless wiretapping program, I went and took some notes, and when I got back here, I eventually was able to get them declassified. They described other interesting theories that grew in that hothouse of legal ideology, protected from the glare of public scrutiny, ideas such as the President is not obliged to follow Executive orders. He is not obliged to give anybody notice that he is violating Executive orders. He can live in a parallel universe in constant violation of his own Executive orders and nothing is wrong with that, other than, of course, the fact that it completely degrades and destroys the entire structure of Executive orders as a law function of the United States of America.
   Another argument is that under article II, the President's power as Commander in Chief, he has the authority to determine what his powers are. Think about that for a moment. They assert article II gives them the authority to decide what the scope of his article II powers are. I seem to remember a decision called Marbury v. Madison saying it is ""emphatically the province of the judicial department to decide what the law is.""
   The last one, my personal favorite, is that the Department of Justice is bound by the legal determinations of the President. It is a good thing that was not the case when President Nixon was the President and made the legal determination if the President does it, it doesn't violate the law.
   So what on Earth has been going on at the Office of Legal Counsel, an office that used to be distinguished for its probity, for its analysis, for its scholarship, an office on which the Department of Justice relies?
   Just as Americans rely on the Department of Justice to provide guidance in our Government, to provide a moral compass within the Department of Justice, the Office of Legal Counsel is supposed to be the place where they try to get it right. How could they try to get it right when they cannot even find a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision on water torture when you are looking up whether it is illegal? If I were a partner in a law firm and a junior associate came to me with a memo such as this that had missed the case on point, do you think he would have much of a career? I don't think so. It is a fatal failure of legal analysis. And yet, where there is supposed to be the very best at the legal counsel of the Department of Justice, they missed all of it. If there has been a systematic breakdown in this institution of Government long known for probity and scholarship, if it has been captured and behind a veil of secrecy rendered a political ideological tool, that is a matter of very legitimate public concern.
   I am pleased to say Senator Durbin and myself have written to the Inspector General of the Department of Justice and to the Office of Professional Responsibility of the Department of Justice to look into exactly that matter.
   I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience with me. I thank the distinguished Senator from Florida for his patience.
   I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE
  The U.S. Senate today passed legislation banning the use of torture by U.S. interrogators, a measure cosponsored by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, fought to include the provision in the House-Senate conference report, and praised today's vote as a clear sign that ""the strength of America is the force of its ideals."" 
  ""Torture is ineffective, unnecessary, andwrong, and it's dangerous to all those who serve the United States of America in harm's way. It should never, ever be used by any person who represents this country, or any agency that flies our flag, and this vote should ensure that it never will be,"" Whitehouse said. ""Now, President Bush must stand with us, and not with the torturers of the Khmer Rouge or the Inquisitors of Spain. I hope the President will sign this legislation and commit his administration to follow it.""
  Last week, General Michael Hayden, director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), publicly admitted for the first time that the CIA had waterboarded three detainees while in U.S. custody. Waterboarding, or water torture, involves strapping a captive in a reclining position, putting a cloth over his face and pouring water over the cloth to create the feeling of suffocation and drowning. The technique causes extreme physical and psychological suffering and has been recognized as illegal torture by a number of U.S. courts and military tribunals, as well as under international law. 
  Despite this precedent, Attorney General Michael Mukasey has said the Department of Justice provided legal guidance to the CIA indicating that the use of waterboarding would be lawful. Mukasey has refused to comment on the legality of waterboarding because the technique was not currently in use, and because of what he described as ""the absence of concrete facts and circumstances."" 
  Whitehouse was the principal sponsor of an amendment prohibiting torture in July, as part of legislation authorizing funding and setting policy for the CIA and other branches of the intelligence community. When that amendment failed in the Senate Intelligence Committee, Whitehouse joined Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and several others to try to add the amendment during House-Senate conference negotiations on the bill last December. That time, it passed, with the support of Congressman Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The Senate voted today to approve the conference report; the House took a similar vote late last year.

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) issued the following statement today on economic stimulus legislation that will provide $300-$600 in rebates to most households, including seniors living on Social Security. President Bush signed the bill into law this afternoon. 
  ""The economic stimulus bill signed by the President today will provide badly-needed help to hundreds of thousands of Rhode Islanders - people who, in tough economic times, have stretched their budgets to pay for gas, for home heating oil, for groceries, or for mortgage or rent payments. I'm pleased that this bill also includes assistance for the many seniors in our state who live on Social Security, and who were excluded from President Bush's original proposal.
  ""I'm going to monitor this process closely to help make sure seniors in our state have all the information they need to take advantage of this badly-needed help. Because for the thousands of Rhode Island seniors struggling every day just to get by, a little breathing room can make an enormous difference.""
  Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, wrote Senate leaders in January to push for the inclusion of seniors who rely on Social Security benefits in the stimulus package. Congress passed the measure last week.

  Rhode Island families at risk of high mortgage payments or foreclosure got some much-needed help in Washington today as the Senate approved legislation strengthening federal homeowners' insurance aimed at middle- and low-income homebuyers. With the security of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insurance, lenders can give reasonable mortgage rates to homebuyers who otherwise might be pushed into the subprime market.  
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) applauded the passage of the FHA Modernization Act of 2007 (S. 2338), which will help more working families afford to purchase or stay in their homes.
  ""For the millions of Americans working hard and saving to purchase a home, a risky sub-prime mortgage shouldn't be their only option,"" Whitehouse said. ""Expanding federal loan insurance will help bring their dream of homeownership closer to reality and will give existing homeowners more flexibility to refinance.""
  For months, declines in the housing market nationwide have led to a dramatic increase in foreclosures rates, particularly among low- and middle-income homeowners with subprime mortgage loans. A June 2007 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that as the market for subprime loans has grown, FHA's market share has fallen, particularly among minority borrowers - meaning that fewer and fewer homeowners are benefiting from stable, secure federal homeowners insurance. In Rhode Island, the number of FHA-backed loans dropped from 3,085 in 2001 to just 481 in 2005 - an 85 percent decline. 
  S. 2338, which passed 93 to 1, will expand both minimum and maximum loan levels and simplify downpayment requirements to make Federal Housing Administration loan insurance available to more working families. The bill will also increase access to post-purchase homeownership counseling for low- and moderate-income homeowners having difficulty making their mortgage payments; remove caps on certain ""reverse mortgages,"" which allow seniors to convert the equity in their homes into cash; and create a pilot program aimed at broadening access to credit for borrowers without sufficient credit histories at traditional credit bureaus.
  Whitehouse is a cosponsor of several other measures to address the mortgage crisis, including: the Mortgage Disclosure Act of 2007 (S. 2153), introduced by Senator Jack Reed (D-R.I.), which would strengthen mortgage disclosure standards for consumer mortgages to ensure subprime borrowers know their payments could increase substantially; the Home Ownership Preservation and Protection Act of 2007 (S. 2452), introduced by Senator Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), which would prohibit a number of unscrupulous lending practices and give homeowners in default of their mortgages new tools to stave off foreclosure; and the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act (S. 2136), introduced by Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), which would give homeowners new leverage in staving off foreclosure and keeping their homes in the event of bankruptcy.

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) congratulated the Island Moving Company of Newport, Rhode Island, on a $10,000 federal grant to support its 2008 Open for Dancing festival. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) issued the award as part of its ""Challenge America: Reaching Every Community Fast-Track Review Grants"" program.  
  ""While many school districts have been struggling to protect arts programming from budget cuts, the Company has worked extensively in schools, teaching creative movement annually to 2,000 Rhode Island students, some of whom are low-income and may not otherwise have access to arts enrichment programs,"" Whitehouse, a member of the NEA's Council on the Arts, wrote in a letter in support of the program's grant proposal in July. 
  The Island Moving Company, the only professional performing troupe based in Newport, works extensively with young people in schools in the area, where 47% of the school-aged population is classified as low-income. The Open for Dancing festival provides students and other area residents interested in dancing the opportunity to take part in a unique performance that highlights not only the art of dance, but also historic Newport landmarks. 
  Open for Dancing 2008 will take place September 17-21, 2008, at Newport locations to be determined by guest choreographers in May. Sites all over historic Newport have hosted performances in the past, including the Preservation Society of Newport, Doris Duke's Rough Point, Fort Adams, Ballard Park, Trinity Church, the Newport Art Museum, the Newport Historical Society and the Navy Base. Truly a local event, festival partners include the City of Newport, the Visitors Bureau and Salve Regina University. 
  ""Artistic Director Miki Ohlsen and I are thrilled to gain this recognition from the National Endowment for the Arts and to have the Senator's strong support,"" said Dominique Alfandre, Executive Director of the IMC.

  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Wednesday, March 14, called on the Senate to pass a budget resolution that funds America's true priorities, from health care for children to assistance with home energy costs to higher education to care for veterans. A member of the Senate Budget Committee, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse spoke at a hearing to begin consideration of the resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008, announced on Wednesday by Chairman Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.).

""I look forward to working to pass a budget that restores fairness to the process and puts America's working families first."" 
   The full text of Whitehouse's remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below.  
   Statement of Sheldon Whitehouse 
   Opening Statement: Senate Budget Committee Markup 
   March 14, 2006 
   Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to address the budget resolution, and for your unyielding commitment to a budget that funds America's true priorities. 
   Over the past two years, I've traveled across Rhode Island talking with middle-class families, people who work hard and play by the rules... but still, too often, struggle just to get by. I will never forget their voices, or their stories - because in this Committee and in this Congress, they are the ones we should be fighting for. They are the ones Chairman Conrad is fighting for, in the budget he will present to us today. 
   But too often this President ignores the struggles of everyday people. Instead of heeding the voices of working Americans and sending this Committee a budget that puts their priorities first, the President's budget once again serves the wealthiest Americans - at the expense of those who need our help the most. 
   I've met families in Rhode Island who were struggling to pay for health care. We have programs like SCHIP, to help make sure low-income children and others can get the health care coverage they need. SCHIP is vital to our state, as well as many others, and I join my senior senator, Jack Reed - a true leader on this issue - in the fight to make sure this initiative has the funding it needs. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, inadequate funding for SCHIP in the President's proposed budget would cause 1.4 million children and pregnant women to lose their health care coverage over the next five years. 1.4 million children and pregnant women would lose their health care coverage over the next five years under this President's budget. That's the wrong priority for America. We can do better. 
   There are families in Rhode Island who can barely afford to heat their homes in winter. Again, Senator Jack Reed has been a champion for the LIHEAP program, which helps lower-income families pay for home energy costs, and it is a key priority for me as well. The President's budget would cut the LIHEAP program by $420 million, compared to the 2007 level adjusted for inflation. That's the wrong priority for America. We can do better. 
   Too many seniors in my state can't afford prescription drugs. We know giving Medicare the power to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices, just as the VA does, can save money - lots of money - but the President won't consider it. That's the wrong priority for America. We can do better. 
   Many young people in the Ocean State are already having difficulty paying for college. Rhode Island's great Senator Claiborne Pell believed the federal government should do more to bring higher education within reach for more Americans. The President pays lip service to this vital program, but refuses to fully fund it - while at the same time proposing cuts to other initiatives that also help young people afford the high cost of a college education. That's the wrong priority for America. We can do better.  
   I've met veterans in Rhode Island, at American Legion posts, at senior centers, at Fourth of July and Memorial Day parades, and at our many community dinners in towns all over the state. They served in our nation's wars from World War II to Vietnam to Iraq, and they wanted us to hear the infuriating truth: that we are failing to support our troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The President wants veterans to pay billions of dollars in fees for the health care they depend on, without a significant increase in funding for veterans' health programs. That's the wrong priority for America. We can do better. 
   And we can do better as we work to repair our broken and dysfunctional health care system, which despite the best doctors, the best nurses, and the best technology, produces some of the worst health care outcomes due to bureaucratic inefficiency and avoidable medical errors. I believe we can expand health coverage to more Americans, improve quality, and save money, through the use of health information technology and quality reform, and Senator Stabenow and I will have more to say about that tomorrow. 
   Mr. Chairman, we on this side of the aisle share so many common values. We believe access to affordable health care should be a right for everyone, not a privilege for the few. We believe in upholding America's promise of retirement security for our seniors. We believe it's more important to guarantee our children a great education for their futures than to guarantee the wealthiest Americans bigger and bigger tax cuts today. And we believe our veterans deserve the care and benefits they've earned - not lost paperwork and mold-infested rooms. 
   But this President's inept management and poor choices have submerged our nation in fiscal quicksand - and now threaten our values and priorities. This latest budget, like the President's budgets of the past six years, present a disgraceful consignment of debt to our children and grandchildren. This leaves America with few good options, and many tough choices. 
   The budget we pass this week will not do everything we want to do. It will not solve every challenge, or meet every need. But let me be clear: it was this President who put tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans before health care coverage for every American. It was this President who chose deepening deficits and, in the words of our chairman, a ""wall of debt,"" over fiscal discipline. It is this President who wants to send tens of thousands more Americans to Iraq rather than care for them when they return home. We cannot repair all this damage in a day, or in a year, or even in a Congress. But we can begin. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, let us begin. I am so thankful for your leadership. Your expertise is second to none. Your courtesy to the minority side is lost on no one, least of all this new senator. And your commitment to an America disciplined in its finances and strong in its values is the right example to set for your colleagues, and the right message to send to the world. I look forward to working with you in the days ahead to pass a budget that restores fairness to the process and puts America's working families first.

WHITEHOUSE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT PASSES IN BUDGET COMMITTEE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT
  The Senate Budget Committee on Thursday, March 15, unanimously adopted a bipartisan measure proposed by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) supporting the adoption of modern health information technology and accepted best practices in clinical settings. Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wisc.), Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), and Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) cosponsored the measure, which was reported to the full Senate this afternoon as part of the Senate budget resolution.  
   ""America has the best doctors, nurses, and technology in the world, but too often, the poorest health outcomes due to bureaucratic inefficiencies and avoidable medical errors,"" said Whitehouse. ""We need to invest more in health IT, and this is a good first step."" As Attorney General of Rhode Island, Whitehouse founded the Rhode Island Quality Institute, a collaborative effort between health care providers, insurers, and government to lower costs and find innovative solutions to our health care crisis. 
   A 2001 Institute of Medicine report found that health ""information technology can contribute to a reduction in avoidable medical errors by standardizing and automating certain decisions, and by aiding in the identification of possible errors, such as potential adverse drug interactions, before they occur."" Many public health technology applications ""are within technical reach at a relatively low cost, but are not widely used because of a lack of targeted public-sector funding."" 
   According to a study published in Health Affairs, only 15-20% of physician offices, and 20-25% of hospitals, had electronic medical record systems as of 2005. By even the most conservative estimate, effective electronic medical record implementation and networking could eventually save more than $81 billion annually, $23 billion of which would accrue annually to the Medicare program. 
   The Whitehouse-Stabenow amendment creates a reserve fund to accommodate legislation that provides incentives or other support for adoption of modern information technology to improve quality and protect privacy in health care, or for payments that are based on adherence to accepted clinical protocols identified as best practices. 
   Reserve funds allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to adjust the budget resolution when certain legislation is passed, to accommodate revenue and spending levels included in the bill. The Whitehouse-Stabenow measure is deficit-neutral, specifying that health IT or best-practices legislation could not increase the deficit over a five-year period.

  Rhode Island's Senators have asked appropriators to permanently block funding for a proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility that would risk serious damage to Rhode Island's waterways and coastal communities, the senators announced today. 
   In a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, Senators Jack Reed (D) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D) asked that the Energy and Water appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008 include language stipulating that ""[n]o funds made available by this or any other Act for any fiscal year may be used to take any action to approve or allow the construction of any liquefied natural gas facility to be located within the City of Fall River, Massachusetts."" Senators Edward Kennedy (D) and John Kerry (D), both of Massachusetts, also signed the letter.  
   ""LNG tankers serving Weaver's Cove would pass by several Rhode Island towns and cities and along miles of populated coastline, putting thousands of Rhode Islanders at risk,"" stated Reed. ""It is essential that we take into consideration the safety of citizens while balancing the long-term, regional energy needs of New England. I am pleased that the Coast Guard voiced its concern last week over the Weaver's Cove proposal. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that plans to build this LNG facility are put on hold."" 
   ""Tankers full of liquid natural gas running through Narragansett Bay pose an immense security, environmental, and safety risk that Rhode Islanders just can't afford,"" Whitehouse said. ""I am dedicated to fighting to prevent this facility from harming Rhode Island's precious marine economy and environment."" 
   The proposed LNG facility would be located on a 73-acre site within Fall River, a dense urban area with a population estimated by the Census Bureau at nearly 100,000 people. To reach the proposed facility, tankers would be required to navigate 21 nautical miles through Narragansett Bay and other navigationally-challenging, inland waterways. 
   In a May 9 letter to Weaver's Cove Energy, Roy A. Nash, captain of the Coast Guard's port for Southern New England, wrote that the company's proposal failed to verify that ""smaller LNG tankers can be safely navigated through this waterway on a consistent, repeatable basis.""

   Dear Chairman Dorgan and Senator Domenici: 
   Thank you for your consideration of our Fiscal Year 2008 Energy and Water Development appropriations requests. We respectfully request you consider this additional priority to include bill language within the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) account to prevent the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility in Fall River, Massachusetts. 
   The proposed facility would be located in a densely populated urban area and would receive LNG in large vessels after those ships make their way through 21 nautical miles of navigationally challenging inland waterways, including through the Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island), Mount Hope Bay, and the Taunton River. This route will require several complex navigational maneuvers in order to pass under the bridges in the area. In fact, the Coast Guard has already concluded that ""extraordinary maneuvers"" would be required, leaving no margin for navigational error, and the company's transit plan appears unsuitable in its current state. 
   The project has strong bipartisan opposition including former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, current Governor Deval Patrick, and Rhode Island Governor Donald Carcieri. Unfortunately, FERC did not take these concerns into consideration during the Federal LNG siting process. Therefore, we respectfully request you include the following language that is narrowly drafted to prevent only this facility from being constructed: 
   No funds made available by this or any other Act for any fiscal year may be used to take any action to approve or allow the construction of any liquefied natural gas facility to be located within the City of Fall River, Massachusetts. 
   If your staff have any questions or need any additional information, please call Jay McCarthy of Senator Kennedy's staff (4-2379) or John Phillips of Senator Kerry's staff (4-3095). 
   Thank you in advance for your consideration of this request.

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today congratulated Brown University on its receipt of a $10 million grant from the National Institute on Aging to conduct research on the quality of long-term health care in this country.  
  ""Long-term care is a critical part of our health care infrastructure, improving the lives of millions of Americans every day. This grant represents not only an awareness of the importance of long-term care services in our aging society, but also a strong commitment to improving these services moving forward,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Aging Committee. ""I'm proud that Brown University will have the chance to continue Rhode Island's leading role in improving the quality of health care across the country."" 
  The $10 million award, allocated over five years, will support a research project by Brown's Center for Gerontology and Health Care Research to collect data on insurance reimbursement claims, hospitalizations, the health of long-term care facility residents, relevant state policies and a myriad of other topics from nursing homes all over America. When completed, Brown's comprehensive database will be a powerful tool to assist policymakers as they assess ways to improve the quality of Americans' health care.
  Whitehouse has worked to improve the quality of health care through his career in public service. As Rhode Island's Attorney General, he founded the Rhode Island Quality Institute, a collaborative effort between health care providers, insurers, and government that has spearheaded initiatives to expand the use of electronic health records and promote evidence-based reforms. 
  In the Senate, Whitehouse has introduced legislation aimed at encouraging health quality reforms, building a national health information technology infrastructure, and linking health care payments to health care quality. A member of the Senate Budget Committee, Whitehouse succeeded in offering an amendment to Congress's fiscal year 2008 budget resolution creating a reserve fund for the adoption of modern health information technology.

   I speak on behalf of the veterans' families who traveled here to Washington to speak to me about their memories of war and the need for this one to end. 
   I speak on behalf of the brave men and women serving in Iraq who have sacrificed so much and whose families anxiously await their return. 
   I speak on behalf of mothers I met who felt they had to buy body armor for their sons and daughters headed for Iraq because they could not trust this administration to provide what was needed. 
   The Senate may have been muzzled in recent days, but Rhode Islanders certainly have not been. More than 2,000 of them have reached out to my office in frustration, in anger, and in concern -- and in the hope that this new Democratic Senate will listen to them and hear them, as this administration will not. 
   I want to share some of what they have written me: 
   I was at Michael Weidemann's funeral. 
   Mr. President, Michael was a 23-year-old Army sergeant from Newport, killed in an IED blast in Anbar Province last November. 
   The letter continues: 
   Please, if nothing else, take care of things, so that we do not have to go through what we went through at that funeral. Michael and my son...were in the JROTC together....He is on his second tour of Iraq. Please, don't make yesterday a dress rehearsal for me. I want my son to come home, safely. 
   From Johnston, Rhode Island: 
   My son...is presently serving in Iraq and on his second tour of duty there....The President's plan ignores the American people who voted for change in November, and who continue to demand we bring our troops home....The people made their voice heard, and if the President isn't going to listen, the Democratic Congress will. The President's policies have failed! 
   From Portsmouth, Rhode Island: 
   President Bush has ignored the advice of experience, lied to us all, lacked any plan and seems to be expecting his successor to solve the problems. It is our only hope that you, as a member of Congress, can work toward bringing our troops home soon. 
   From Kingston: 
   I am appalled at the loss of life -- today it was reported 20 more service people were killed. The Kurds are deserting rather than fight in Baghdad....We are not just losing people, we are losing big money. We have seven grandchildren. What kind of debt are we placing on those future generations? 
   From Warwick: 
   We never should have begun this war, let's now have the sense to end it, not prolong it. Please do whatever you can to stop the president's initiative to increase our military presence in Iraq...., to spend even more money waging a war that your constituents have indicated they no longer support. 
   From North Kingstown: 
   We are looking to you to do whatever is in your power to stop the U.S. escalation of troops in Iraq. I and many in our nation feel this will only make a bad situation worse, widen what is essentially a civil war and lead to further casualties and costs without contributing towards a political solution....We are counting on you and your colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up and be counted and forge a bipartisan solution to end this war. 
   And finally, a woman from Cumberland forwarded me a message she sent to President Bush: 
   My nephew...is in the 82nd Airborne serving our country in Iraq. He is the bravest person I have ever known, along with all the other men and women serving this country. I am proud to be an American! Please, please, on behalf of my family and the families of all U.S. troops -- bring them home now! 
   Mr. President, these voices will not be unfamiliar to anyone in this body. In every State, we have heard similar voices. You have heard them in Colorado, Mr. President. My friend, Senator Sanders, has heard them in Vermont. People all across America are speaking to all of us, and it is time for us to listen and to show that we have heard and to start to bring our soldiers home. 
   The President has not heard these voices. He wants to send tens of thousands more troops to Iraq. He calls this a surge. We consider it a grave mistake. 
   Tomorrow, our vote can stop the parliamentary maneuvers that have stalled us, and this great deliberative body can begin to debate the most pressing question of this day. 
   Let's talk for a moment about that question. The other side wishes to debate every question, any question -- any question but the escalation by this President of our troops in Iraq by over 21,000 men and women. But this question we want to debate is not a question selected by Democrats for political reasons. It is possible here to choose self-serving questions and to force a debate on those questions just to make a political point. But we have not done that. 
   This question, whether to escalate the war in Iraq, is not an invention of the Democratic Party. It is not an invention of the Senate. It is President Bush, who proposed to send tens of thousands more troops into harm's way and to escalate this conflict, who has presented this question. This question is what was presented to us by President George W. Bush, and by him alone, and it is the pressing question of today. 
   For weeks, we on this side of the aisle have emphasized and reemphasized our strong commitment to having a real debate -- a debate to a vote -- to telling the American people where we stand and to casting our votes on the precise question the President of the United States has presented to America. But we have been impeded, obstructed, maneuvered away from this critical question. 
   The other side argues that to dispute this President's judgment is to fail to support the troops -- even though that judgment has failed the troops and has failed our country and has left us with few good options. But that is a false choice, Mr. President. And this hour demands better of this institution. 
   There are ways to accomplish the change America demands, and that reason and good conscience dictate. For instance, I believe that rather than send a single additional American soldier into the sands and marshes of Iraq, this President can announce clearly and unequivocally that our troops will be redeployed from Iraq and will soon come home. 
   The most powerful motivating force at our country's disposal today is the prospect of our redeployment out of Iraq. Let me repeat that. The most powerful motivating force at our country's disposal today is the prospect of redeployment out of Iraq. Using this power wisely, deftly, and thoughtfully would accomplish three critical objectives that, as I have said, would make great strides toward security in Iraq and stability in the region. 
   First, a clear statement of our intent to redeploy our troops from Iraq would eliminate the sense there that we are an Army of occupation. This in turn would quiet the nationalist sentiment of the Iraqi people, now aroused against us. Many Iraqis are now so opposed to our presence they think killing American soldiers is acceptable. 
   Second, without America's intervening presence, the world community would have to face directly the consequences of the situation in Iraq. The prospect of our departure would compel the world to take a more active role to work together with America to bring peace and stability to the region. We cannot continue as we are now, in every meaningful way completely alone. 
   Third, Iraq's neighbors will be obliged to assume greater responsibility for averting the risk of a Sunni-Shiite conflict igniting in Iraq and spreading beyond Iraq's borders. Without us in Iraq as a police force for a civil war, neighboring nations will have an enlivened incentive to avert a wider war. 
   Finally, the Bush administration's preoccupation with Iraq leaves us weakened in our capability to address other obligations around the world, from the changing situation in North Korea, to the ongoing battle for Afghanistan, to the serious threat posed by Iran's nuclear program. 
   Mr. President, these are serious matters, and they deserve the serious and sustained attention of the Senate. I hope tomorrow's vote will allow us to bring this question that attention. 
   Mr. President, I will support that vote tomorrow. I ask other Senators, who hear our fellow Americans' genuine and sincere concern about our national interest, will do the same. 
   I will support not only the resolution disapproving of the President's escalation plan and supporting our troops, but also other, stronger measures that will follow, and that will continue to put pressure on this administration to finally bring our troops home. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE URGES SUPPORT OF FEINGOLD-REID AMENDMENT TO REQUIRE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ
  Requiring President Bush to redeploy U.S. forces from Iraq by March 2008 is a smart, responsible strategy that will give the American people the change of course they have demanded, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said today in an address on the Senate floor.

   Floor Statement for Sheldon Whitehouse (as prepared for delivery) 
   On Ending the War in Iraq 
   May 16, 2007 
   Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because more than three thousand of our men and women have lost their lives, and tens of thousands more have returned home wounded - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because hundreds of billions of America's tax dollars have been sunk into the sands and marshes of Iraq, with much of that funding lost to waste, fraud, or abuse by those who have neither Iraq's nor America's best interests at heart - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because the public record of this conflict - reflected in the many retired generals who have spoken out against the conduct of the war, and the many books and articles chronicling its planning and execution - reveals catastrophic mistakes and misjudgments that have raised serious questions about this administration's capacity for leadership - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because that same administration misused and distorted intelligence, arguing that America should go to war on the basis of information that proved to be untrue or highly misleading - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because despite the millions of Americans who joined together to call for a new direction in Iraq, this President chose to escalate the conflict - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because the President and Vice President and their allies would rather pick a political fight with this Congress, using false rhetoric like ""micromanage"" and ""precipitous withdrawal,"" than answer tough questions from the American people - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because the prospect of our troops' redeployment is the single most powerful force at our disposal, to galvanize unity and cooperation among the Iraqi factions and effect real change - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   And because even after all this, this President still refuses to listen to the American people and stubbornly fails to give this country the change of course it demands - it is up to this Congress to act to bring American troops home from Iraq. 
   Some claim this strategy is risky. But the greater risk by far, Mr. President, would be to fail to seize the opportunity a redeployment of our troops presents us. 
   To announce clearly to the world that American troops will soon leave Iraq will change the dynamic there in a positive way. 
   It will give us the chance to renew and rebuild diplomatic ties in the region and around the world that have been so badly damaged by this President and this President's war, and restore America's prestige and standing amongst our friends. 
   It will send a signal to the insurgents who foment violence in Iraq that they will no longer be able to use the United States military as a recruiting tool for extremists, and it will motivate efforts by the Iraqis to secure and stabilize their nation. 
   It will give the Iraqis the impetus to step forward and do the things our military leaders say they must do for the surge to succeed - passing the hydro-carbon law to allow equal sharing of oil revenues among all Iraqis, and measures to facilitate provincial elections, for example. 
   It will give us the time and resources to restore our extraordinary military to the strength and level of readiness our troops deserve. 
   And it will give us the freedom and resources to look to the many challenges that still confront us here at home - from soaring gas prices to a broken health care system. 
   But to achieve all these things, we must take the first step. We must make it clear that we will bring our troops home from Iraq. 
   Mr. President, the measure offered by Senator Feingold with the support of the distinguished Majority Leader is a smart, responsible, and effective step to repair what the President has left broken. It would require the President to redeploy our troops from Iraq by March 31, 2008. After that date, funds would only be available for three specific, limited purposes: targeted counterterrorism operations; protecting U.S. infrastructure and personnel; and training and equipping Iraqi security forces. 
   This plan gives our troops in the field the resources they need today - and it gives them a strategy worthy of their service as they look to tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to support the Feingold-Reid amendment, and I yield the floor.

  ""We will not stop fighting to bring our troops home.""

WHITEHOUSE AGAIN SPEAKS OUT FOR CHANGE IN IRAQ
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) again urged President Bush to change course in Iraq in a speech on the Senate floor earlier today. Last week, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, along with a delegation of members that traveled to Iraq last month, met privately with President Bush in the Oval Office and shared his frustration at the President's failure to seek a new direction in the now four-year-old war. 
   ""The question of what to do in Iraq is not a political fight between President Bush and the Democrats in Congress,"" Whitehouse said. ""It's a struggle between the President and the will of the American people. It's long past time their voices were heard."" 
   Whitehouse traveled to Iraq in mid-March as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. While in the country, he met with U.S. troops, including Rhode Islanders stationed in Fallujah; American military commanders, including General David Petraeus; and high-ranking Iraqi officials.  
   Whitehouse joined a majority in the Senate to pass critical war funding legislation that would support U.S. forces in Iraq and compel President Bush to begin redeployment of American troops from Iraq within four months, with a goal of having all combat troops out of Iraq by March 31, 2008. Whitehouse is also a cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) and supported by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) that will limit funding for the war after April 2008 to counter-terrorism operations, training, and force protection. 
   Whitehouse began his remarks with an expression of sorrow at yesterday's horrific shooting at Virginia Tech. ""We may never know why it happened,"" said Whitehouse. ""What we know for certain is that in our shared grief, we will find shared resolve: to care for the wounded, comfort the families and friends of those who died, support the University and its community, and search for answers, in hope that this tragedy may never be repeated.""

   Floor Statement of Sheldon Whitehouse 
   On the War in Iraq 
   April 17, 2007 
   Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as I come to the floor this morning to share my concerns about this country's disastrous policies in Iraq, our nation is mourning the unimaginable loss of 32 people in the tragic and senseless shootings at Virginia Tech. 
   The thoughts and prayers of every American are with the victims of this horrific act, the deadliest shooting episode this country has ever seen. 
   We are only just beginning to learn exactly what happened yesterday - and we may never know why it happened. 
   What we know for certain is that in our shared grief, we will find shared resolve: to care for the wounded, comfort the families and friends of those who died, support the University and its community, and search for answers, in hope that this tragedy may never be repeated. 
   I've been a member of the Senate now for just over 100 days. I'm here, and many of my freshmen colleagues are here, because the people of Rhode Island, along with millions of other people across this country, looked at the war in Iraq and saw something that needed to change. 
   They saw hundreds of billions of dollars spent, much of it wasted on reconstruction contracts that were sloppily-managed or ill-advised. They saw one after another in a succession of retired generals protesting the failed strategy in Iraq and arguing for a different course. They saw reports that the Bush administration had misused and politicized our national intelligence services, to press a case for war that did not exist. They read books chronicling a heartbreaking series of mistakes and misjudgments. And they saw tens of thousands of American soldiers returning home grievously injured - and more than three thousand men and women who will never return. 
   The country saw one of the greatest foreign policy disasters in our nation's history, and demanded a new direction. The American people voted for change. They were sincere, sober, and correct in their judgment, and this new Congress listened - but President Bush did not. Instead of committing to redeploy our troops from Iraq, the President chose to escalate the conflict. And now, instead of working with this new Congress to forge a new strategy worthy of the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform, the President and Vice President are on the attack - not against the Iraqi leaders slow-walking us through the conflict, but against the American people who have rightly questioned their failing policy. 
   The question is this: how much longer will the President refuse to listen? 
   Since joining the Senate just over 100 days ago, I've worked to put pressure on the Bush Administration to redeploy our troops from Iraq. In mid-March, as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I traveled to Iraq to get a firsthand look at the situation on the ground, see the hard work of our dedicated troops, and talk with our military commanders and Iraqi political officials. 
   In Baghdad, our delegation met with several of the officers leading America's military engagement in Iraq, including General David Petraeus, Lt. General Raymond Odierno, and Lt. General Martin Dempsey, as well as members of our U.S. Embassy country team. We also met with Mahmud al-Mashhadani, speaker of the Iraqi parliament, and National Security Minister Shirwan al-Waili. In my capacity as a member of the Committee, I also met members of our nation's intelligence staff and their Iraqi counterparts. 
   In Fallujah, we spoke with Gen. Walter E. Gaskin, Marine commander in Anbar province, and other commanders of the Marine Expeditionary Force. I met three brave Rhode Islanders there: 
   Kristie St. Jean from Woonsocket, Christopher Tilson from Providence and Anthony Paulo from Westerly, who are serving our nation with dedication, courage, and honor. 
   On our return, we traveled through Germany to visit Landstuhl Regional Medical Center at Ramstein Air Base, where our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen badly injured in Iraq and Afghanistan are med-evac'd to receive critical medical care before their return home. Major Andrew Risio, who hails from Ashaway, Rhode Island, is helping provide care to our wounded soldiers in that facility. 
   Mr. President, the young men and women I met with in Iraq, and their families, have made tremendous sacrifices, and their expert performance and can-do attitude reinforce my pride in the American spirit. The security posture we maintain around our military bases is strong, and our troops are working hard to secure the cities and countryside of Iraq. The work of our intelligence and special operations personnel, which often runs non-stop through the night, is remarkable, and exhibits a level of professionalism in which every American can be very confident. 
   The achievements of our forces in Iraq are serious - and here is what impressed me from our trip: so is their commitment that the Iraqis must assume responsibility for the security and governance of their country. In nearly every briefing, at every level of command, the message came loud and clear that our military is highly focused on accomplishing a handover of security responsibilities so as to bring our troops home. 
   As a young soldier in a mess hall told me, the Iraqis ""won't stand up until we start to stand back."" 
   And I do believe the Iraqis need more motivation to stand up. There is key legislation the Iraqi parliament must pass that our military commanders believe is necessary if this surge is to succeed. Critical measures to facilitate provincial elections; regulation and revenue-sharing for the oil industry; reverse de-Baathification; and restrict sectarian militias have stalled. Iraq must take action to move this legislation forward and step up its security presence. That will require real commitment and urgency, and it would be putting it mildly to say I was not reassured by the signals I received from our meetings with Iraqi officials. There is a severe disconnect between the urgency of our generals about this legislation, and the absence of urgency, or energy, on the part of Iraqi officials. 
   One soldier I met put it in simple terms: ""If your parents are willing to pay for the movies so you don't have to use your own money, or if you can get your big sister to do your homework for you, who wants that to stop?"" 
   Mr. President, it does have to stop, and this Congress is taking action to make that clear. I was proud to vote with a majority of the Senate to pass binding, bipartisan legislation to require the safe redeployment of our brave troops, beginning in 120 days with the goal of having the vast majority of our troops redeployed from Iraq by the end of March. I'm also a cosponsor of the recently introduced Feingold-Reid legislation to continue to put pressure on the Bush administration to safely redeploy our troops. 
   Only the kind of pressure a decision to redeploy creates will provide the motivation needed for Iraq to take the necessary steps to assume responsibility for its own governance and security. An announcement that our troops will be leaving will encourage the Iraqis to step up and take their security seriously, discourage the insurgents, and send a message to the world community that stability in Iraq will no longer be the responsibility of America alone. 
   Last week, I had the opportunity to take that message directly to the Oval Office. 
   In a meeting with President Bush and several of our colleagues who had recently traveled to Iraq, I urged him that to announce a redeployment and a change of course was the strongest force in his hands. I also gave the President letters sent to me from Rhode Islanders with family members serving in Iraq. Those messages said loudly and clearly that it is time to bring our troops home. 
   But rather than acting to change course, the President keeps playing political games. He has threatened to veto legislation this Congress passed to provide critically-needed funding for our troops in the field. In our meeting last week, he said he was looking forward to a ""classic political showdown."" 
   The question of what to do in Iraq is not a political fight between President Bush and the Democrats in Congress. It's a struggle between the President and the will of the American people. It's long past time their voices were heard.

WHITEHOUSE: SURVEILLANCE BILL MUST PROTECT AMERICANS' CIVIL LIBERTIES
  As Congress debates pivotal legislation updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) urged the Senate to include strong protections for Americans' civil liberties. 
  Whitehouse, a member of both the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, is fighting to strengthen the bill's safeguards against executive overreaching. Concerned by significant flaws in the Protect America Act (S. 1927), Whitehouse has pushed to ensure the FISA court has an oversight role in cases where the administration eavesdrops on Americans traveling overseas, or when innocent Americans' conversations are intercepted incidentally.
  ""I urge my colleagues to remember that the issue we are grappling with is a simple one: on what terms will we allow this administration to spy on Americans?"" Whitehouse said today. ""Unless we really believe that when Americans leave our country, we leave our civil liberties behind; unless we really believe that this government should have unfettered power to eavesdrop on conversations of families vacationing in Europe or soldiers serving in Iraq; then the authority to spy on Americans abroad cannot be left under the exclusive control of this administration."" 
  In a Senate floor speech earlier this month, Whitehouse sharply criticized several legal theories propounded by the Office of Legal Counsel, within the Department of Justice, in secret legal memos related to surveillance. The theories suggested, among other things, that the Bush administration did not have to issue a new executive order if it chose to depart from the terms of a previous executive order.
  Because the only current restriction on wiretapping of Americans abroad is contained in an executive order, Whitehouse stressed the need for a new FISA law that included stronger protections for Americans overseas.
  The text of Whitehouse's remarks, as prepared for delivery, is below.
  Floor Statement of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, as prepared for delivery
  On Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
  December 17, 2007
  Just recently, the Attorney General of the United States published an opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times on our ongoing work to improve the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This follows closely on a similar opinion piece by Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell in the New York Times. I ask unanimous consent that each of these be entered into the Record.
  Both go on at some length about the importance of new legislation on foreign surveillance activities. They devote paragraph after paragraph to this. But the two leaders of America's law enforcement and intelligence communities completely ignore - never once mention - the issue that is actually in dispute here: on what terms will we allow this administration to spy on Americans?
  The heart of our debate today is the question of spying on Americans, 1. when they are outside the country, or 2. when they are incidentally intercepted by surveillance targeted at someone else. 
  This - wiretapping of Americans - has been the entire subject of our work on surveillance - and Judge Mukasey and Admiral McConnell never once even mention the topic.
  There are really only two possibilities here, and each is regrettable. One is that these two gentlemen simply don't know what is going on. That seems unlikely, because Director McConnell at least has participated in hearings on the subject, where we've discussed in detail our concerns about wiretapping Americans, and members of my staff are working through the details of the issue on a nearly daily basis with lawyers from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice. 
  So that leaves only one alternative: that these two gentlemen do know what is going on, and just choose to talk past the real issue; ignore its very existence. That is a shame, and I hope it is not the early propaganda phase of a Bush Administration effort to replicate the August stampede that got us into this pickle.
  Since they haven't mentioned it, here's the problem.
  The Protect America Act, passed in the August stampede, contains no statutory limitation on this administration's ability to spy on Americans traveling abroad whenever it wants, for whatever purpose. 
  The only limitation that now exists on that power is Executive Order 12333, which says that the administration will not wiretap Americans overseas unless the Attorney General determines that that person is an agent of a foreign power. 
  The problem, as I noted in a speech in this Chamber recently, is the following proposition, contained in a secret Bush Administration Office of Legal Counsel memo related to surveillance activities:
  ""An executive order cannot limit a President. There is no constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order. Rather than violate an executive order, the President has instead modified or waived it.""
  In other words, the only thing standing between Americans traveling overseas and a government wiretap is an executive order that this President believes he is under no obligation to obey, and may secretly disregard. 
  For months, as we have worked to repair the flawed bill of August, the question of spying on Americans has been the issue of concern. 
  I and my staff, and many of my colleagues and their staffs, have been working diligently and in good faith to solve this problem. 
  What I have seen has been a thoughtful exchange by well-intentioned people who are committed to keeping America safe without trampling on the rights of Americans. We have talked not only with one another, on both sides of the aisle, but with people in this administration - including the staff attorneys at the DOJ and DNI. We have worked almost all the way toward making sure that Americans who are incidentally intercepted enjoy meaningful ""minimization"" protections. We have worked I think all the way toward making sure that a court order is required to wiretap an American who happens to be overseas. 
  For both Director of National Intelligence McConnell and Attorney General Mukasey to write op-eds as if the issue of spying on Americans abroad has no role in this debate, when it has been the key and central issue in this debate, is disappointing. How big does the elephant have to be before they acknowledge it's in the room?
  Ignoring this problem may serve the Bush/Cheney interest in unaccountable executive power. But it does not protect Americans' privacy, and it does not make America safer.
  I urge my colleagues to remember that the issue we are grappling with is a simple one: on what terms will we allow this administration to spy on Americans? It is a question with real implications for our democracy, our civil liberties, and ultimately, the security of this nation.
  Unless we really believe that when Americans leave our country, we leave our civil liberties behind; unless we really believe that this government should have unfettered power to eavesdrop on conversations of families vacationing in Europe or soldiers serving in Iraq; then the authority to spy on Americans abroad cannot be left under the exclusive control of this administration. It is a matter that must be solved in the legislation Congress passes dealing with foreign intelligence.
  That is why we have been working on this question so hard.
  This is a serious question - I wish the two gentlemen leading the key departments of government involved had recognized that it exists - and I urge my colleagues to insist on the protections we have worked so hard for, that protect Americans from surveillance, as we go forward on this legislation.
  We have come a long way. Chairman Rockefeller is owed our gratitude, and Chairman Leahy. I appreciate the efforts of the distinguished ranking members, Senators Kit Bond and Arlen Specter. 
  We are on the verge of an historic moment. Let us not let this moment slip away.

WHITEHOUSE, 18 SENATORS URGE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO REVIEW E-PRESCRIBING FOR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
  After a Senate hearing made clear that new federal regulations allowing electronic prescribing for controlled substances are badly-needed and long-overdue, 18 senators joined U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) in calling on Attorney General Michael Mukasey to review the issue and urged the Drug Enforcement Administration to issue new rules promptly. 
  ""DEA regulations permitting [electronic prescribing for controlled substances, or EPCS] have been delayed for years, inhibiting wider uptake of e-prescribing, and postponing the realization of this technology's benefits,"" the senators wrote today. ""It is our belief that both the health care and law enforcement communities would benefit greatly from a secure EPCS system, and that technological solutions are at hand. We urge your prompt attention to this matter, and request that DEA issue regulations for EPCS as quickly as possible.""
  Studies show that widespread e-prescribing, used today in about 18 percent of doctors' practices, could save $20 billion annually, as patients would experience fewer adverse drug events (ADEs) and would be more likely to adhere to a medication regimen. The Center for Information Technology Leadership (CITL) found that a national e-prescribing system could prevent 2.1 million ADEs - 130,000 of which are life-threatening - and 190,000 hospitalizations per year.
  In a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee two weeks ago, Whitehouse pressed DEA Deputy Assistant Administrator Joseph T. Rannazzisi, of the Office of Diversion Control, on DEA's timeframe to revise federal rules governing dispensation of controlled substances, such as pain medications, antidepressants and some drugs used to treat asthma in children. Current regulations require that doctors write paper prescriptions for these pharmaceuticals, with the result that that most doctors resort to writing all their prescriptions by hand rather than maintain a paper system for controlled substances and an electronic system for non-controlled substances. 
  Under questioning from Whitehouse, Rannazzisi agreed to provide the committee, within two months, with information on the timing of the rulemaking process for e-prescribing of controlled substances, including the announcement of proposed rulemaking. 
  ""You've seen intense bipartisan concern about this. This is not an issue where we're going to go away,"" Whitehouse told Rannazzisi. ""I think it's important that the different elements of the administration be willing to look beyond their own brief and consider more broadly the cost-benefit to the country of getting past this, and move with according dispatch.""
  Also signing the letter were Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Richard Burr (R-NC), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Tom Coburn (R-OK), Susan Collins (R-ME), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Edward Kennedy (D-MA), John Kerry (D-MA), Herb Kohl (D-WI), Tim Johnson (D-SD), Barack Obama (D-IL), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Jack Reed (D-RI), Arlen Specter (R-PA), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), John Thune (R-SD), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

REED, WHITEHOUSE CALL FOR 80 PERCENT CUT TO GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTANTS BY 2050
  In an effort to slow and reverse the devastating effects of global climate change, Sens. Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) joined with Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), and several of their colleagues in introducing The Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act. The bill calls for an 80% reduction - compared to 1990 levels - in global warming pollutants by 2050 and offers the most progressive and comprehensive solution to reduce greenhouse gasses across the nation. 
   ""Climate change is one of the defining issues of our time, and the United States must provide meaningful action to address this problem. Climate change affects our environment, economy, and security. We must take steps at the local, state, and national levels to slow, stop, and reverse global warming emissions. It is time for the federal government to step up in this fight, and that is what this legislation seeks to do,"" said Reed, who cosponsored a similar bill with Senator Jim Jeffords (I-VT), last year.  
   ""Global warming is a serious and pressing issue that can no longer be ignored. We can already see climate change at work in warmer winters, rising sea levels, and flowers in bloom in January,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ""This bill will tackle global warming at its source, reducing airborne pollutants and greenhouse gasses to slow the potentially disastrous effects of higher temperatures across the world."" 
   This legislation sets out a roadmap of targets, requirements, and incentives that EPA will use to reduce U.S. emissions and help stabilize global atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Specifically, the act sets a goal of achieving a reduction in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that will help stabilize global concentrations below 450 parts per million--a critical level as recognized by leading climate scientists. To achieve this goal, the United States must reduce its emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and make additional reductions between 2020 and 2050. The bill includes a combination of economy wide reduction targets, mandatory measures, and incentives for the development and diffusion of cleaner technologies to achieve these goals. 
   ""Global climate change is a major concern for Rhode Island. It affects our coastal communities, drinking water, energy supply, economy, and public health,"" said Reed. ""Tourism is a very important part of Rhode Island's economy and global warming brings stronger storms that can wash away beaches, roads, and homes. Our efforts to reverse these trends will not come without cost, but we simply can not afford the price of inaction."" 
   ""From Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay to ecosystems and communities all over the world, global warming is a serious threat that demands immediate and urgent action,"" said Whitehouse. ""This measure will put the United States in a position of real global leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and I'm proud to support it."" 
   Global warming is leading to increased energy and water demands, and contributing to stronger storms throughout the area. The rising ocean temperatures also bring diseases that affect oysters, scallops and quahogs. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has warned that the ocean around Rhode Island could rise as much as 12 inches in the next 50 years. 
   Reed also noted that evidence shows that in Providence, the average temperature in the summer has increased 3.3 degrees over the last century. Higher temperatures allow insects that carry disease, such as mosquitoes and ticks, to show up in new areas, cover a wider range, and have longer periods of time when they are active. Rhode Island has the second-highest incident of Lyme disease in the nation. 
   The legislation is supported by such national groups as The Earth Day Network, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense, Environmental & Energy Study Institute, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, League of Conservation Voters, National Audubon Society, National Environmental Trust, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, and U.S. PIRG.

WHITEHOUSE SHARES STRONG SUPPORT FOR VETERANS
  As he prepares to return to Washington for the start of a new session of Congress, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) met with Rhode Island veterans to discuss both progress made last year and the work still to be done, particularly to support service members returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.
   ""We have only begun to repay America's veterans the debt we owe them,"" Whitehouse said. ""I was proud to stand with Jack Reed to support more funding for health care, for research into post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, and for much-needed repairs to an overburdened claims processing system. We will keep fighting to honor the service, and sacrifice, of our veterans."" 
   At a lunch discussion at the Nelson-Mack-Narragansett VFW Post in Cranston today, Whitehouse shared news on Congress's work on veterans' issues, and heard from local veterans about their concerns in the coming year.
   A vocal supporter of veterans during his first year in the Senate, Whitehouse said in a speech on the Senate floor in March: ""When we ask ordinary men and women to do the extraordinary, and stand up and serve in harm's way, we know we can never fully repay what they and their families have given us. But we can surely pledge to them that we will give them what they need in the field, and that when their service has ended, we will care for them adequately.""
   Congress Made Significant Progress on Veterans' Priorities in 2007
   $6.6 Billion Increase for Veterans' Programs: Fiscal Year 2008 appropriations legislation (P.L. 110-161) passed by Congress and signed into law in December included a significant funding increase for veterans' initiatives - $6.6 billion more than in Fiscal Year 2007 and $3.7 more than President Bush requested. The appropriations bill funds nearly 100 percent of the Independent Budget, an annual funding proposal authored by AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Paralyzed Veterans of America.
   More Support for Veterans' Health Care: The FY08 appropriations bill fully funds veterans' medical care, VA hospitals, and medical research; and allows the VA to increase funding for combat-related injuries such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), signal wounds of the Iraq war. Whitehouse cosponsored the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act, which requires a comprehensive policy to provide for the care of service members with serious injuries or illnesses; improve the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of service members with TBI and PTSD; and address deficiencies that contributed to the crisis at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The Wounded Warriors Act passed as an amendment to the FY08 Defense Department spending authorization bill (H.R. 1585).
   Investigating Administrative Separations Based on Personality Disorder Diagnosis: H.R. 1585 also included another Whitehouse-supported measure to require a report by the Secretary of Defense on all cases in which active-duty or Reserve members who had served in Iraq or Afghanistan received an administrative separation from the Armed Forces on the basis of a personality disorder (S. 1817).
   Lifting Prohibitions on Concurrent Receipt: H.R. 1585, which authorized Defense Department spending for 2008, permitted concurrent receipt as of December 31, 2004 for veterans rated 100% disabled. The bill also provided for payment of special compensation, equal to the amount of retired pay forfeited because of the prohibition against concurrent receipt, for service members medically retired for a combat-related disability. While President Bush has vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act over an issue unrelated to veterans, it is expected that the administration will work with Congress to resolve the matter in coming weeks.
   Addressing the ""Widow's Tax:"" H.R. 1585 also took steps to address the ""widow's tax,"" authorizing a monthly allowance for surviving or former spouses of deceased service members whose DOD Survivor Benefit Plan is offset as a result of their VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation.
   Preventing Suicide by Veterans: Whitehouse cosponsored legislation to strengthen veterans' suicide prevention initiatives, the Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act (S.479), which was signed into law in November.
   Whitehouse acknowledged that much remained to be done to address the needs of veterans and their families, especially those returning from war in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is a cosponsor of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007 (S.22), legislation introduced by Senator Jim Webb (D-Va.) that would give new veterans the same educational benefits as were provided after World War II. These benefits would include tuition, room and board, and a stipend for living expenses.

WHITEHOUSE HEALTH IT MEASURE IN 2008 BUDGET BLUEPRINT
  As the nation recognizes National Health IT Week 2007, Congress today approved a fiscal 2008 budget resolution that included a measure proposed by U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) to support health information technology and accepted best practices in clinical settings. 
   ""Health information technology is a crucial piece of the health care puzzle,"" said Whitehouse. ""I am encouraged - and proud - that this budget will provide this critical support for the adoption of modern health information technology and accepted best practices in clinical settings."" 
   Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, joined Stabenow during the committee's consideration of the budget in March to introduce a deficit-neutral reserve fund to provide incentives for the adoption of health information technology within the medical community, and payments based on adherence to clinical protocols identified as best practices. 
   The reserve fund will allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to adjust funding levels within Congress's overall budget to allow for increased spending on health IT and best practices, so long as that spending does not increase the deficit. The Budget Committee approved the amendment unanimously. 
   Up to 100,000 lives are lost in the United States each year due to avoidable medical errors. Electronic medical records can reduce mistakes such as adverse drug events by automating and standardizing procedures; improving the coordination of chronic care and bio-surveillance; and making hospitals and physicians' offices more efficient. 
   Currently, only 25 percent of hospitals and 20 percent of physician offices utilize electronic medical records. The RAND Corporation has estimated that widespread implementation of effective electronic medical record systems could save $81 billion or more annually. 
   Whitehouse is a cosponsor of a Senate resolution, passed Tuesday by unanimous consent, recognizing the value of information technology in health care and officially designating the week beginning May 14, 2007 as National Health Information Technology Week (S. Res. 202). The week provides a forum for public and private organizations who support health information technology to gather, share ideas, and communicate with members of Congress in an effort to raise awareness about the importance of health IT.

  Calling global warming the single greatest threat to the world's natural environment, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today announced new legislation calling for a national strategy to address the threat of climate change to America's wildlife. 
   A member of the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works (EPW), Whitehouse said that global warming has already begun to have a severe and lasting impact on wildlife populations and marine ecosystems in Rhode Island and around the world. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), chair of the EPW Committee, will be an original cosponsor of the bill.
   ""As the waters of Narragansett Bay grow warmer, cold-water fish species with high commercial value, like winter flounder, have been replaced by warmer-water species, like scup, whose value to our fishermen is lower,"" Whitehouse said. ""Melting sea ice in Greenland is pushing polar bears closer to inhabited villages in search of food. As we work to mitigate the causes of global warming, we must also take urgent action to address its effects on wildlife, oceans, and other natural systems on which we all depend.""
   The Global Warming Wildlife Survival Act will:
   * Set New National Strategies to Address Climate Change's Impact on Wildlife and Oceans. The bill would direct the federal government to develop coordinated national strategies to identify, monitor, and protect or restore wildlife populations and habitats that are likely to be harmed by global warming; and to protect, maintain, and restore coastal and marine ecosystems to help them better withstand ocean acidification, sea level rise, and other stresses related to climate change.
   * Create Advisory Panels to Share Scientific Research and Advice. The bill would create Advisory Boards, with members appointed by the President of the National Academy of Sciences, and a new National Global Warming and Wildlife Science Center within the U.S. Geological Survey, to conduct research and provide scientific and technical advice on strategies to help wildlife, oceans, and coastal ecosystems adapt to global warming. A special panel would also be convened to look specifically at the impacts of climate change on endangered species.
   * Provide Resources to Help States Protect Wildlife and Marine Ecosystems. The bill would provide grants and other federal resources to help states, territories, and Indian tribes study wildlife, oceans, and habitats that may be affected by global warming, and plan and implement programs to mitigate the effects of climate change on these populations.

  Senate Democratic freshmen today introduced a bill to establish an independent, bipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting to investigate U.S. wartime contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Commission would significantly increase transparency and accountability and generate important solutions for systematic contracting problems, potentially saving taxpayers billions of dollars.
  The Commission will study and investigate the impact of the government's growing reliance on civilian contractors to perform wartime functions. It will assess the extent of waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement of wartime contracts, and the extent to which those responsible have been held accountable.  
  The Commission will work in consultation with a newly-expanded Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) that will be authorized to audit defense wartime contracts for logistics support, as well as other federal agency contracts for security and intelligence functions in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. This collaborative effort will result in specific findings and recommendations to improve inter-agency wartime contracting.
  ""Hundreds of billions of dollars have been allocated for reconstruction and stabilization efforts in Iraq alone, creating a strong potential for waste, fraud and abuse. The Commission will be retroactive in terms of accountability and proactive in terms of providing recommendations on wartime contracting. It will also address the widespread use of government contractors instead of American combat troops,"" said Senator Webb. 
  ""We are outsourcing this war in ways we've never seen,"" continued Webb. ""Defrauding the government of millions of taxpayer dollars should not be considered 'the cost of doing business.' It's time for Congress to stand up on behalf of the American people and say: 'We want our money back.'""
  ""During World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt said, 'I don't want to see a single war millionaire created in the United States as a result of this world disaster'. And so Missouri's own Senator Harry Truman created a committee that investigated and uncovered millions of dollars in wasteful, wartime spending,"" Senator McCaskill said. 
  ""We know that the cost plus contracts used in Iraq and Afghanistan are nearly blank checks to private defense contractors, primed for waste, fraud and abuse. We need a new investigatory body, inspired by the Truman Committee, to protect our tax dollars and bring better accountability to the way we do business while at war,"" continued McCaskill.
  The bill, filed by Senators Jim Webb (D-VA) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO), is inspired by the work of the ""Truman Committee"" which conducted hundreds of hearings and investigations into government waste during WWII at an estimated savings of more than $178 billion (in today's dollars) to the American taxpayer.
  This is the first joint initiative of freshman Senators, including Webb, McCaskill, Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jon Tester (D-MT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ben Cardin (D-MD), and Bob Casey (PA).
  Majority Whip Dick Durbin, Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin and Senators Tom Carper, John Kerry, Diane Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Barack Obama and Tim Johnson also serve as co-sponsors of the original amendment, filed as no. 2206, to the National Defense Authorization Act.
  Waste, Fraud, Abuse and Mismanagement of Wartime Contracts
  In Tuesday's USA Today story entitled ""Largest Iraq Contract Rife with Errors,"" government auditors reviewing contractor KBR Inc.'s annual cost estimate for services in Iraq discovered that the company proposed $110 million in charges for housing, food, water, laundry and other services on bases that had been shut down. (http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2007-07-16-iraq-auditors_N.htm) 
  An audit conducted by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found that the Parsons Company received $186 million over the past three years to construct 142 health-care centers in Iraq. As of May 10, only 15 centers had been completed-and only eight were open to the public
  Outsourcing the War, Lack of Accountability
  There are now more contractors (180,000) than military personnel (156, 247) in Iraq. A list of companies contracted in support of Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom does not exist. Figures on how much the government is paying contractors does not exist.
  The Government Accountability Office reported that between fiscal years 2003 and 2006, the U.S. government has allocated more than $300 billion to support stabilization and reconstruction efforts in Iraq alone. This increasing reliance on contractors exposes billions of taxpayer dollars to potential misuse and waste.
  ""As a former Pennsylvania Auditor General, I know firsthand the need to aggressively root out waste in government,"" said Senator Casey. ""But it is especially egregious for companies doing business in Iraq to profit from fraud and abuse for taxpayer dollars to be lost as our troops are in harm's way.""
  ""For too long we've heard horror stories of waste, fraud and abuse by government contractors. Montana taxpayers work too hard to subsidize this kind of greed,"" said Senator Tester. ""The wars we fight and shed blood for are not for profit. This legislation brings long overdue accountability and real change to the way American contractors do business in Iraq and Afghanistan.""
  ""This proposal is long overdue,"" said Senator Klobuchar. ""Again and again we have seen contractors wastefully spend hard-working American taxpayer dollars while this Administration sat idly by - enough is enough. When I was a county attorney, we always said, 'follow the money and you'll find the bad guys.' This Commission will follow the money and it will make sure people are held accountable for waste, fraud, and abuse.""
  ""Iraq is a target rich-environment for corruption, and monitoring the expenditure of U.S. resources requires vigilance,"" said Senator Whitehouse. ""This Commission will ensure that the billions of dollars provided for reconstruction in Iraq are accounted for - so the hard-earned money U.S. taxpayers provide will serve the purposes we intend, for the benefit of both the American and the Iraqi people.""
  ""This administration has unapologetically attempted to privatize virtually every government function they can get their hands on,"" said Senator Brown. ""The rampant private contracting in Iraq is the most egregious example to date - but it's certainly not the only one.""

  Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today called for a Justice Department investigation into allegations of illegal voter suppression tactics by Republican political operatives, including former Karl Rove aide Tim Griffin, during the 2004 elections. Griffin is now serving as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.
  ""At a time when the Department's political independence and its commitment to enforcement of civil rights statutes have been called into doubt, it is vitally important that the Department thoroughly investigate these allegations of unlawful voter suppression, and the apparent failure of Department employees to forward to the appropriate authorities information they had about this practice,"" the senators wrote in a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. 
  The letter cites voter suppression incidents by the Republican Party in the 1980s. During the 2004 elections, e-mail evidence suggests that Tim Griffin, then a political operative at the Republican National Committee, knew and approved of a program to ""cage"" voters - sending a political campaign mailing to targeted voters and challenging the right to vote of those whose mail was returned undelivered - in predominantly African-American neighborhoods in Jacksonville, Florida. Last year, Griffin was appointed interim U.S. Attorney without Senate confirmation, displacing a federal prosecutor who has testified he was told he was fired to make the job available for Griffin.
  Today, Senators Kennedy and Whitehouse demanded an investigation by two DOJ watchdog agencies to determine whether Griffin may have violated the Voting Rights Act or other federal laws, and whether Justice Department officials knew of Griffin's potentially unlawful activity when he was named U.S. Attorney. 
  Kennedy and Whitehouse are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into the unprecedented firing late last year of several U.S. Attorneys. Senator Kennedy, a longtime champion for voting rights, will chair a Judiciary Committee hearing this Thursday on oversight of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. Whitehouse served as U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island from 1994-1998. 
  ""It is very disturbing to think that Department officials may have approved the appointment of a United States Attorney knowing that he had engaged in racially targeted vote caging,"" the senators wrote. ""Moreover, it is very disturbing to think that senior officials were aware of this practice and did nothing to refer their information to relevant officials within the Department for investigation and a determination as to whether it was a violation of a consent decree or law within the Department's jurisdiction to enforce."" 
  The full text of the letter is below.
  June 18, 2007
  Alberto Gonzales
  Attorney General
  United States Department of Justice 
  950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
  Washington, D.C. 20530
  Dear Attorney General Gonzales:
  We write to request that the Department of Justice promptly investigate allegations that the Republican National Committee engaged in ""vote caging"" during the 2004 elections. We also ask that you investigate whether any Department officials were aware of allegations that Tim Griffin had engaged in caging when he was appointed United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, and whether appropriate action was taken. Caging is a reprehensible voter suppression tactic, and it may also violate federal law and the terms of applicable judicially enforceable consent decrees. 
  Caging is a voter suppression tactic whereby a political campaign sends mail marked ""do not forward"" to a targeted group of eligible voters. A more aggressive version involves sending mail to a targeted group of voters with instructions to sign and return an acknowledgment card. The campaign then creates a list of those whose mail was returned undelivered and challenges the right of those citizens to vote - on the ground that the voter does not live at the registered address. There are many reasons why registered mail might be ""returned to sender"" that have nothing to do with a voter's eligibility. A voter might be an active member of the armed forces and stationed far from home, or a student registered at his parents' address. Even a typographical error during entry of the voter's registration information might result in an address that appears invalid. 
  The Republican Party has a long and ignominious record of caging - much of it focused on the African American community. For example, in 1981 the RNC sent a mass mailing into predominantly African American neighborhoods in New Jersey and used the resulting 45,000 letters marked ""undeliverable"" to challenge those voters' eligibility. In 1986, the RNC used similar tactics in an effort to disenfranchise roughly 31,000 voters, most of them African American, in Louisiana. These tactics led to litigation and the RNC's eventual signing of two consent decrees, still in effect, which bar the RNC from using ""ballot security"" programs ostensibly intended to prevent voter fraud as a tactic to target minority voters. 
  In 2004, however, allegations of caging by Republican officials arose again - this time over an effort to suppress votes in Florida. Emails sent in August 2004 by Tim Griffin, then Research Director and Deputy Communications Director of the RNC, demonstrate his knowledge and approval of a spreadsheet listing caged voters in predominantly African American neighborhoods in Jacksonville, Florida. (See attached.) Two years later, Mr. Griffin was appointed, without Senate confirmation, as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Such actions appear plainly to violate the consent decrees signed by the RNC in 1981 and 1986. We ask that you investigate whether in these circumstances Mr. Griffin or others may also have violated the Voting Rights Act, the National Voter Registration Act, the mail fraud statute, or any other federal statute. 
  It also appears that high-ranking officials in the Department knew of Mr. Griffin's involvement in caging. Monica Goodling recently testified to the House Judiciary Committee that she discussed concerns about Mr. Griffin's involvement in caging with Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty during a session to prepare for Mr. McNulty's Congressional testimony. It is very disturbing to think that Department officials may have approved the appointment of a United States Attorney knowing that he had engaged in racially targeted vote caging. 
  Moreover, it is very disturbing to think that senior officials were aware of this practice and did nothing to refer their information to relevant officials within the Department for investigation and a determination as to whether it was a violation of a consent decree or law within the Department's jurisdiction to enforce. 
  We, therefore, ask the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility to conduct an investigation to determine who in DOJ knew about Mr. Griffin's potentially unlawful activity before he was named interim U.S. Attorney, and whether appropriate action was taken on that knowledge, and to recommend whatever action is appropriate.
  At a time when the Department's political independence and its commitment to enforcement of civil rights statutes have been called into doubt, it is vitally important that the Department thoroughly investigate these allegations of unlawful voter suppression, and the apparent failure of Department employees to forward to the appropriate authorities information they had about this practice.

WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF WAR IN IRAQ
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) commented today on the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the war in Iraq. 
   ""Tomorrow, March 19, marks the end of the fifth year that American troops have spent fighting in Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of brave men and women have endured month after month in a strange land, thousands of miles from home and family. Tens of thousands of them have returned home wounded. Nearly four thousand have given their lives. They and their families are in our prayers, today and every day.
   ""Our troops have served this nation with courage and honor, and now, it's time to start bringing them home. President Bush took our country to war on false pretenses, without a plan to win the peace. His administration's misjudgments and poor decisions have cost our nation trillions of dollars, sapped the strength of our armed forces, hurt our standing in the international community, and distracted us from the urgent tasks of dismantling al Qaeda and dealing with a resurgent Taliban. Meanwhile, they have done little to alleviate the human suffering of the Iraqi people.
   ""It's clear this President will do nothing to end this endless war. I will continue to push, as Rhode Islanders have urged me to do, for a redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq, and I join millions of Americans working to see that our next President will seek a new direction.""
   Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, visited Iraq a year ago.

WHITEHOUSE SAYS
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today delivered the following statement at a hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee on the risks of lead poisoning for children's health. 
   Thank you, Madam Chairman, for convening this hearing. Under your leadership, this Committee has focused intently on the ways in which we influence our environment and how we can be better stewards of the world around us - from cleaning up pollution in our air and water, to reversing the devastating damage caused by global climate change.
   We do this to preserve and protect; to preserve the natural resources on which we and future generations will depend, and to protect families from changes in our natural and man-made environments that can harm our lives and health. All too often, those threats appear in places we least expect.
   In recent weeks, we've been reminded of another danger found where we least expect it: in our children's toys. Hundreds of thousands of toys and other merchandise have been recalled because they contain lead paint, a poison that poses a serious risk to children's health and well-being.
   Children exposed to lead can develop learning disabilities, hearing impairments, and behavioral problems, even at extremely low levels - and this damage cannot be reversed.
   We in Rhode Island know the dangers of lead poisoning well. For years, tens of thousands of Rhode Island children have lived in homes contaminated by lead paint, exposed to lead in paint chips or dust. More than 30,000 children have been diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels in our state. Last year alone, lead poisoning was diagnosed in an additional 500 children.
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as many as 1.7 million children aged five and younger are affected by lead poisoning. Nationwide, more than 80 percent of older homes, constructed before 1978, contain lead paint.
   While the danger of lead poisoning is in no way restricted to Rhode Island, I'm proud that our state has been a leader in the fight to raise awareness about the dangers of lead poisoning, and take strong action to reverse it.
   When I served as Rhode Island's Attorney General, we brought a public nuisance action against the companies that manufactured lead-contaminated paint, an innovative approach that, after several years and two trials, finally resulted in a jury verdict last year that the paint companies must abate the damage they caused.
   That decision was a victory for Rhode Island's children - the first of its kind in the nation. Today, we are moving ahead on abatement plans to ensure that our state's homes are safe for our children and their families.
   I'm proud that this committee has turned its attention to the serious risk presented by lead contamination and look forward to today's hearing.

WHITEHOUSE CONGRATULATES NEWPORTER ON PRESTIGIOUS ARTS AWARD
  U.S. Senator and National Council on the Arts member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) delivered the keynote address today at a ceremony honoring Nicholas Benson of Newport, the first Rhode Islander to receive a prestigious national award for folk and traditional arts. Benson, a third-generation stone letter carver and calligrapher, was recognized this morning along with eleven other recipients of the 2007 National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)'s National Heritage Fellowship.  
   ""On behalf of the people of Rhode Island, I congratulate Nick on his recognition as a 2007 National Heritage Fellow - an award made possible by the commitment and vision of Rhode Island's own Senator Claiborne Pell, who helped found the NEA,"" said Whitehouse. ""Nick's work has added immeasurably to our state and our nation's cultural heritage. His dedication to the traditional forms of stone carving will help ensure that they survive for generations to come."" 
  The National Heritage Fellowship is the highest public honor awarded for folk and traditional art. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the program, which includes a one-time award of $20,000 for the recipients. 
   Benson oversees the John Stephens Shop, founded in 1705 on Newport's Thames Street. His work, and that of his father, graces the National Gallery of Art, the Kennedy Center, the National Cathedral, the World War II Memorial, the Franklin Roosevelt Memorial, and the gravestones of President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis in Washington, D.C.; the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama; the Poet's Corner in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York; and the Georgia O'Keefe Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
   Whitehouse was appointed as an ex-officio member to the National Council on the Arts, the advisory body to the NEA, by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in July. The NEA was created in 1965 with the enactment of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act, signed into law by then-President Lyndon Johnson. The bill was originally sponsored by Senator Pell, a champion of the NEA throughout his life.

REED, WHITEHOUSE OPPOSE BUSH ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE $4.7 MILLION FOR RHODE ISLAND HOMELAND SECURITY INITIATIVES
  In an effort to prevent the Bush Administration from cutting funds for homeland security programs vital to safeguarding Rhode Island's cities and ports, U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) along with several colleagues last night sent a bipartisan letter to President Bush opposing the reported budget cuts. A November 26 document released from the Office of Budget Management indicated that the budget for fiscal year 2009 would cut funding in half for critical domestic homeland security initiatives and eliminate grant programs that benefit Rhode Island's port security, transit security, and emergency management. 
  ""At a time when this Administration asks for hundreds of billions of dollars to conduct its war in Iraq, it should also provide adequate support to protect Americans here at home and reject these misguided cuts to vital homeland security programs,"" wrote the senators.
  The reported funding cuts would directly impact three critical programs the Administration recently signed into law, including the Port Security Grant Program, which funds security improvements to America's ports; the Transit Security Grant Program, which helps secure high-risk mass transit; and the Emergency Performance Management Grant Program, which allows communities across the country to develop emergency management plans to respond to a disaster. 
  Rhode Island received funding from all three grant programs in fiscal year 2007, including $1,201,570 from the Port Security Grant Program; $1,219,833 (Providence) from the Transit Security Grant Program; and $2,360,209 from the Emergency Management Performance Grants.
  ""These homeland security programs were all authorized by legislation this Administration supported and signed into law,"" the senators concluded. ""Unfortunately, real security does not come cheap and cannot be achieved with mere words of support.""

WHITEHOUSE PRAISES NEW POLICY LIMITING POLITICAL INTERFERENCE AT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) praised today's move by Attorney General Michael Mukasey to restore safeguards against political interference at the Department of Justice. Earlier this year, Whitehouse, a former U.S. Attorney, closely questioned former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales about Bush administration changes to a policy regarding communications between the White House and the Department of Justice that significantly expanded the number of officials who could discuss pending cases and investigations.  
  ""Today's new policy is a clear, unmistakable and welcome repudiation of the Gonzales era, and this change takes a significant step towards restoring Americans' confidence in the integrity of our justice system,"" Whitehouse said. ""I'm encouraged that Attorney General Mukasey has honored his commitment to begin restoring the firewall against White House politicization at the Department.""
  In the Clinton administration, a total of only seven people at the White House and the Justice Department were permitted to initiate discussions of ongoing cases or investigations, including the President, Vice President, and Attorney General. During the tenure of Attorney General John Ashcroft, that policy changed to authorize more than 40 people at the Department and more than 400 people in the White House to initiate such conversations, opening up unrestricted channels for political interference. 
  Whitehouse, a former U.S. Attorney, questioned Attorney General Gonzales about the revised policy during two Judiciary Committee hearings. When pressed, Gonzales said: ""I would be concerned about inappropriate access to ongoing investigations ? if that's encouraged by this kind of memorandum, I think it's something that we ought to rethink."" 
  Whitehouse specifically expressed concern that Gonzales himself signed a 2006 memorandum further expanding the authority to discuss cases to over 900 people in the executive branch, explicitly including the chief of staff and counsel to the Vice President.
  ""What on Earth business does the Office of the Vice President have in the internal workings of the Department of Justice with respect to criminal investigations, civil investigations, ongoing matters?"" Whitehouse asked Gonzales during a July 24 Judiciary Committee hearing. ""As a general matter, I would say that that's a good question,"" the Attorney General responded. The new policy excludes the Office of the Vice President from discussions about pending cases.
  In September, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed legislation Whitehouse introduced that would require the Department of Justice and the White House to notify Congress which officials, beyond the seven authorized by the Clinton-era rules, have engaged in such discussions (S. 1845). 
  ""I'm very grateful to Chairman Pat Leahy, and to my colleagues Senator Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein, for the leading role each of them has played in our investigation into the Bush administration's unprecedented firing of several U.S. Attorneys earlier last year, and for their support of my participation as a freshman senator. This change in policy shows that the responsible use of Congress's powers of oversight can make a significant difference in our government,"" Whitehouse said.

WHITEHOUSE SLAMS EPA'S DENIAL OF RHODE ISLAND REQUEST TO SET TOUGH POLLUTION STANDARDS
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse sharply criticized the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s decision tonight to deny long-overdue waiver requests that would Rhode Island and several other states to crack down on pollution from cars and trucks on their roadways. Under the Clean Air Act, states cannot set their own pollution control standards without a waiver from EPA.  
  ""The EPA's ruling is disgraceful,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) committee. ""The Bush administration's refusal to carry out the duties imposed on it by the Clean Air Act have polluted our air and water, further endangered the health of millions of Americans, and cost us precious time in our fight to address the looming threat of global warming. We can't afford to delay strong steps to address global climate change. We will keep fighting to pressure this administration to do the right thing and allow states like Rhode Island to take action.""
  The standards proposed by the states would cut greenhouse gas pollutants by 392 million metric tons by 2020 - a reduction equivalent to taking 74 million cars off the road for an entire year, according to a report by Environment Rhode Island.
  During an EPW Committee hearing in April, Whitehouse took EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson to task over the agency's continued failure to address the waiver requests. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency that EPA does, in fact, have the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate vehicle CO2 emissions, contrary to the agency's insistence otherwise. In November, California Attorney General Jerry Brown filed suit against the EPA for its refusal to issue a decision on the waivers.

WHITEHOUSE: NEW TAX FORM SHOULD HELP SENIORS CLAIM REBATE
  A simplified tax form released today by the Internal Revenue Service will help Rhode Island seniors take advantage of rebates offered under new economic stimulus legislation, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said.  
   Under the new law, the federal government will provide rebate checks, starting at $300, to low- and middle-income Americans, including seniors living on Social Security benefits and disabled veterans or their survivors. But Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging who pushed to make sure the bill included benefits for seniors, was concerned that some older Rhode Islanders might be deterred from claiming their rebates because of the legislation's requirement that everyone seeking a rebate must file a 2007 federal tax return - even if he or she does not owe taxes, as would likely be the case for tens of thousands of Rhode Island seniors.
   Today, the IRS announced that seniors will be able to fill out a special version of Form 1040A that makes clear which information they must provide in order to receive a rebate. The agency also posted an extensive ""Frequently-Asked Questions"" page on its web site, www.irs.gov, including a section specifically aimed at seniors.
   ""No senior should miss out on this much-needed assistance due to the burdens of filing a tax return,"" Whitehouse said. ""I'm glad the IRS is taking steps to make this process easier for seniors, and I'll continue to watch closely to see whether there's anything more the IRS, or we in Congress, can do to help."" 
   More than 138,000 Rhode Islanders over the age of 65 received Social Security benefits in 2006, the last year for which data is available, with Social Security benefits averaging just $12,374 per year. Nationwide, 61 percent of seniors who receive Social Security benefits did not pay income taxes in 2006, a technicality that would have left them ineligible to receive aid under an earlier proposal negotiated between President Bush and the House of Representatives. 
   Whitehouse had urged Senate leaders in a letter last month to include aid to seniors in any legislation aimed at bolstering the nation's sluggish economy, noting that many Rhode Island seniors are having difficulty making ends meet amidst the high cost of energy, housing, and prescription drugs. ""For the thousands of Rhode Island seniors struggling every day just to get by, a little breathing room can make an enormous difference,"" he said. The final stimulus bill was signed into law last week.

WHITEHOUSE SAYS
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) made the following remarks on the Senate floor today. The Senate is considering the Higher Education Access Act, which would raise the maximum Pell Grant to $5,100 next year and $5,400 by 2011; cap monthly loan payments at 15% of discretionary income; and increase the income level at which a student is automatically eligible for the maximum Pell Grant from $20,000 to $30,000, a change that will simplify the financial aid process for many students. 
  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, many years ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson said: 
  We have entered an age in which education is not just a luxury permitting some men an advantage over others. It has become a necessity without which a person is defenseless in this complex, industrialized society. We have truly entered the century of the educated man.  
  Those are important words to ponder as we consider the legislation now before the Senate. I thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi for their extraordinary leadership on this issue as well as so many others, and for the opportunity I have to speak today. 
  I am here to talk about an initiative that revolutionized higher education in America, and that is the Pell Grant. Inside this desk at which I stand are the names of Senators who have occupied it before me. I can actually open this drawer, take out the stuff in the drawer, and in the drawer I can see the names of Senators who have gone before me at the bottom. Here is John O. Pastore of Rhode Island, who served with great distinction and was my last Democratic predecessor in the Senate. 
  It is hard to see because he was not a proud man and wouldn't write it in great big letters, but I can see, very carefully written, ""Pell, RI,"" Senator Pell of Rhode Island. It is a remarkable thing for me to be here in this context because Senator Claiborne Pell and his wife Nuala have long been cherished friends. Senator Pell is both a mentor to me and a constant reminder of the positive impact an individual person can have through public service. 
  I am so glad the Senator Salazar from Colorado is presiding at this particular moment because I wish to describe to everyone a remarkable event that I was privileged to witness a few years ago. I was at an event in Rhode Island with a number of Senators, including the Senator Salazar. During that event, Senator Pell came to the tent we were all under in his wheelchair. As many of our colleagues know, he habitually uses a wheelchair now. The group became very quiet as he entered out of the respect we in Rhode Island have for this great and dedicated public servant. The Senator from Colorado, Mr. Salazar, went over to Senator Pell, took his hand and shook it and told him: I would not have been able to attend college if it had not been for the support of the Pell Grant program. Now, I am standing here before you today, a United States Senator, thanks to the vision and foresight you showed years ago, your vision that every American should be able to get a college education. 
  It was an unforgettable moment then; it gives me goosebumps to recount it now. It happened because Senator Pell understood the difference that higher education could make in the lives of America's young people - from the Ken Salazar, who now serves with such distinction in this great institution, to those who will seize the opportunities of America in the decades to come. 
  Today, the program that bears Senator Pell's name is in our hands. 
  Each spring, high school seniors in Rhode Island and across the country wait anxiously for acceptance letters from the colleges of their choice. I have been through this experience recently with my daughter and all of her classmates. But for many American families, almost as important as those letters from the admissions office are the letters from the financial aid office. I have heard from so many families in Rhode Island who look ahead to the day when their children will go off to college and seize their bright futures, but wonder how they will ever be able to afford it without some form of financial aid, either from the institution itself or from the Federal Government. 
  As the cost of higher education soars higher, up 35 percent in 5 years, students and parents face ever more difficult financial choices. Many go into debt, not only through Federal student loan programs, but increasingly to private lenders. Many shoulder enormous burdens of debt that can stay with them throughout their lives. When that high school senior receives a Pell grant, money that does not have to be paid back, the dream of college becomes more of a reality. 
  Since the Pell Grant program began, these grants have been a critical form of Federal aid that has helped literally millions of young people across this country achieve a level of education that was previously out of their reach. Unfortunately, Pell Grants now represent only 33 percent, one-third, of the total cost of a 4-year public university. Twenty years ago, a Pell grant would have paid 60 percent of that cost. 
  As higher education for Americans has become more and more important, not just to their individual opportunities but also to our national economy and competitiveness - remember the words of Lyndon Johnson so many years ago: ""We have truly entered the century of the educated man"" - we need education to compete. Through that time Pell grants have actually lost value versus the actual cost of college. But the support for low-income students through the Pell grants has slid away over the years, until it is now only 33 percent of the cost of a public university. So we must recommit ourselves to making college affordable to all students. 
  The Promise Grants created by the Higher Education Access Act will guarantee that students who qualify for the maximum Pell Grant will receive $5,100 for the 2008-2009 academic year and $5,400 by 2011. For us in Rhode Island, this will mean $10 million in additional grant funds for Rhode Island students next year and, over the next 5 years, $86 million. It will also expand family access to Pell Grants, better reflecting today's economic realities. 
  Senator Pell is part of a strong tradition of Rhode Island Senators who have committed themselves to making higher education accessible to all Americans. This tradition is proudly carried on by Senator Pell's direct successor in this Chamber, my friend, Senator Jack Reed, a champion of higher education access and affordability. I admire his work to provide more Pell Grant aid for students who need it the most - those who work and those whose family income is under $30,000. 
  We see in this Chamber and across the country every day - every year in September when a new group of students go off to college - the tremendous influence the work of Senator Pell has had on the fabric of our Nation and on the lives of the millions of young Americans who have used Pell Grants to make their dream of higher education a reality. 
  I applaud this important legislation. Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi have worked hard together in a wonderful bipartisan spirit to put together legislation that will advance the strength of our country and the opportunity for our young people. This is a vital step and an important investment we must make in the future of America's young people.

WHITEHOUSE SPEAKS OUT AGAINST LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS TERMINAL IN WEAVER'S COVE
  Concerned that a proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Fall River, Massachusetts, could pose a significant risk to public safety and the environment in Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) spoke on the Senate floor today in support of legislation that would require state approval to build LNG facilities. 
  ""I have heard Rhode Islanders' deep concern at the enormous environmental and security risks posed by LNG tankers passing so close to their homes and communities. Yet their voices have not adequately been heard in the current process for permitting LNG terminals,"" Whitehouse said. ""I am dedicated to fighting to prevent this facility from harming Rhode Island's precious marine economy and environment - and to making sure that my state and its people have an adequate voice in the permitting process."" 
  The full text of Whitehouse's statement, as delivered, is below. Attached is a chart he used during his remarks to illustrate the security zone that would be required for an LNG tanker traversing Narragansett Bay.
  Floor Statement of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse 
   On State Approval for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminals
   June 19, 2007
  I thank Senators Bingaman and Thune for their courtesy. I am here today to express my support for an amendment sponsored by my colleague, Senator Cardin, regarding State approval for liquefied natural gas terminals. I am a cosponsor of this important bipartisan amendment with Senators Mikulski, Snowe, Dodd, Kerry, Kennedy, Boxer, Lieberman, and my senior Senator, Jack Reed of Rhode Island. 
   Our country is grappling with a serious and difficult question: how to meet our growing energy needs without depleting our national resources, threatening our environment or endangering our people. 
   I strongly support the work of Senators Boxer and Bingaman, with many of our colleagues, to take a significant step forward in our use of alternative and renewable fuels. But as we develop these new and emerging fuel sources, we must take great care to balance our need for energy with other imperatives.
   Liquefied natural gas is rapidly assuming a larger share of the overall natural gas market. Over 40 new LNG terminals are now proposed for construction, many of which are planned near heavily populated areas or environmentally sensitive coastal areas. Unfortunately, in their haste to expand this market, the LNG industry and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have dismissed the risks this poses to public safety and the environment. I am particularly concerned about a proposed LNG terminal in Fall River, MA, a town of nearly 100,000 people, barely over the State line from Rhode Island. 
   This is Rhode Island's treasured Narragansett Bay. The Bay is used, particularly on beautiful summer days such as today, for commercial and recreational boating and fishing. Tens of thousands of Rhode Islanders live along its shores, and our Bay is in many ways the economic heart, as well as the environmental and recreational heart, of our Ocean State. 
   Now, to reach the LNG facility proposed for Fall River, LNG tankers would have to navigate 21 nautical miles through Narragansett Bay, passing directly by the homes and businesses of 64,000 Rhode Island residents. Along the way, tankers would pass under four heavily trafficked bridges and execute what the Coast Guard itself recently described as extremely challenging navigational maneuvers, as many as 130 times per year. 
   Moreover, the tanker requires a security zone around it as it proceeds through the Bay. Here is the tanker. This is the size of the security zone it requires, completely occupying the east passage going up through Narragansett Bay between Newport and Jamestown. It would displace all recreational boaters and other cargo boats and disrupt bridge traffic as it transits.
   The residents of my State of Rhode Island have spoken loudly and in large numbers against the LNG terminal proposed for Fall River. I have heard their deep concern about the environmental and security risks posed by LNG tankers passing so close to their homes and communities. Yet their voices have not adequately been heard in the current process for permitting LNG terminals. 
   This amendment would help correct this flaw and give all States and communities the seat at the table they deserve, by requiring the concurrence of affected States for permits to build liquefied natural gas terminals.

BOXER, LAUTENBERG, WHITEHOUSE JOIN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS TO DISCUSS DEMOCRATS' EFFORTS TO MAKE AMERICA MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT
  Sen. Barbara Boxer, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and Sens. Frank Lautenberg and Sheldon Whitehouse joined environmentally friendly CEOs Tuesday to discuss the Senate's energy legislation and how its energy-efficiency provisions would stimulate innovation and competition, strengthen our economy, and protect our environment. Democrats are moving ahead this week with The Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007, which will also create jobs, protect consumers and strengthen national security.  
   ""A sound energy policy must include real steps to reduce global warming pollution,"" Boxer said. ""By making government buildings more energy-efficient, ensuring the government buys fuel-efficient vehicles, and providing support for cities and counties to improve their own buildings, this energy bill would go a long way toward making the government a model of energy efficiency, an important first step in addressing the challenge of global warming.""
  Said Lautenberg: ""Our current energy policy is taking a tremendous toll on the bottom line of families and businesses across the nation. The Senate's energy bill moves us in the right direction by reducing our dependence on foreign oil and creating markets for alternative energy, while combating global warming. I am pleased my green buildings bill is a part of this effort to set a bold, new energy policy for America."" 
  ""Senate Democrats understand that our energy needs in the future must be met in ways that safeguard our air, water, and open spaces today,"" Whitehouse said. ""I'm proud to support legislation that will make the federal government a leader in energy-efficient, environmentally-sound building standards - further reducing the threat of global warming."".

WHITEHOUSE JOINS CRANSTON FAMILY IN FIGHT TO CURE GENETIC DISEASE
  In an effort to combat the leading genetic cause of death in children under the age of two, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) has cosponsored legislation to accelerate research into spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a disease that affects the Calise family of Cranston and thousands of others across the country. The Spinal Muscular Atrophy Treatment Acceleration Act (S. 2042) would rapidly advance treatments for SMA, a hereditary disorder that destroys nerves controlling voluntary muscle movement and occurs in nearly one in 6,000 births nationally. 
  ""Researchers have already made great progress in studying potential treatments and cures for this deadly condition,"" said Whitehouse. ""I'm proud to join my colleagues, especially Rhode Island's Patrick Kennedy, in an effort that will bring hope to thousands of children in our country."" 
  Whitehouse met earlier this year with Michael Calise, whose daughter Corinna was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy at 11 months of age. Michael and Michelle Calise organized the Rhode Island chapter of FightSMA - Corinna's Angels - in 2001. The Calises have advocated for additional funding for SMA in order to find better treatments and a cure for the genetic disease, which can affect crawling, walking, head and neck control and even swallowing. The mutated gene that causes SMA is carried by one in every 40 people; when two gene carriers have children, each child has a 1 in 4 chance of developing the potentially fatal disease.
  ""Simply put, we know what causes SMA, we know how to fix it, we just need the support and funding for extensive clinical trials to make it happen,"" Michael and Michelle Calise said. ""We realize that there are many worthy causes in this world. We are grateful that Senator Whitehouse has chosen to support SMA."" 
  According to the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation, research over the past several years has advanced so remarkably that treatment - or a cure - for SMA may soon be within reach. The Spinal Muscular Atrophy Treatment Acceleration Act will direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Coordination Committee to coordinate activities within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other federal health programs relating to SMA. Existing SMA clinical trial sites will be upgraded and unified into a national clinical trials network. The bill also directs the HHS Secretary, in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to report to Congress within six months and submit specific recommendations to improve and expand SMA drug treatment development.
  The Spinal Muscular Atrophy Treatment Acceleration Act was authored by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). Whitehouse is an original cosponsor, along with Senator John Warner (R-Va.).

  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence last week approved the FY'08 Intelligence Authorization bill, which includes a provision sponsored by U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), John Warner (R-Va.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), and Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) to require the Director of National Intelligence to produce a formal intelligence assessment on the potential national security impacts of climate change. 
   Specifically, the unclassified amendment offered by the Senators requires the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to produce a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on the impacts to national security from global climate change within 270 days. It requires other agencies with climate change-related expertise to cooperate in writing the NIE, and authorizes the DNI to work with outside groups as needed. Unlike a similar provision in the House version of the authorization bill, this amendment incorporates suggestions from the DNI.  
   ""Climate change projections call for massive disruptions to the global economy and health, including potential humanitarian crises, massive migrations, and impacts on energy resources. The Intelligence Community should help prepare our nation's leaders for these scenarios,"" Senator Feinstein said. ""That's why Senators Hagel, Warner, Whitehouse, Snowe, Mikulski and I offered a bipartisan measure to require the preparation of a formal National Intelligence Estimate on the potential national security impacts of global warming - and this amendment is now part of the bill approved by the Committee. Let me make clear one point: this estimate will not divert resources from other critical Intelligence Community priorities, such as the gathering of intelligence on rogue nation states, terrorist groups, or potential proliferation activities.""
   ""As I have said for many years, the way forward is to responsibly address the issue of climate change with a national strategy that incorporates economic, environmental and energy priorities,"" Senator Hagel said. ""These priorities are also an integral part of U.S. national security. It is important that we assess the potential geopolitical effects of global climate change and the implications for U.S. national security. This estimate will provide information we need to continue to help make our country secure in the years to come."" 
   ""In my 28 years in the Senate, I have focused above all on issues of national security, and I see the problem of climate change as fitting in with that focus. As a number of retired flag officers, including Generals Zinni and Sullivan, reported last month, global climate change poses a destabilizing threat to US military operations, heightens global tensions, and strains long-standing international alliances. As the Senate proceeds to legislate on climate change, it is vitally important that we receive the Intelligence Community's comprehensive view on the problem,"" Senator Warner said. 
   ""Global warming threatens our environment, our communities, and our national security,"" Senator Whitehouse said. ""Guidance from our intelligence services will help Congress better prepare for the security risks and challenges of climate change, and, we hope, help galvanize Americans to begin to take steps to reverse it.""
   ""The issue of global warming is no longer a question of science - it is a question of political will,"" Senator Snowe said. ""Global warming is a comprehensive problem that demands a comprehensive solution. And part of that solution should include this report so we have a full understanding of this issue and its effect on our nation's security for years to come.""
   ""The world is facing a climate crisis. U.S. action on global warming is long overdue,"" said Senator Mikulski. ""We need a better understanding of how climate change will impact the global economy, international health and political stability. That's why I joined my colleagues to call for this NIE - to give policymakers the information we need to make the decisions we must to protect the American people.""
   The amendment also stipulates that the Intelligence Community's assessment should be based on the conclusions of the latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC report is the consensus of more than 600 leading scientists representing 42 countries from around the world. 
   The Panel's most recent report concluded with very high confidence (90 percent certainty) that human activity has 'very likely' caused the earth's temperature to rise more than 1 degree over the last century alone. And the scientists predict that the rate of this warming will only continue to increase. If we do not take action now, the earth's temperature could rise between 3.2 to 7.8 degrees - or even higher - by the end of the century. Sea levels could rise 7 to 23 inches. Arctic sea ice would disappear entirely. And extreme weather patterns could become the norm.

WHITEHOUSE DECRIES BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S BROKEN PROMISE TO VETERANS
  Following a series of meetings with Rhode Island veterans, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) spoke on the Senate floor this morning to call on the Bush administration to support our troops through improved access to health care and other benefits for veterans, especially those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   ""When we ask ordinary men and women to do the extraordinary, and stand up and serve in harm's way, we know we can never fully repay what they and their families have given us,"" Whitehouse said. ""But we can surely pledge to them that we will give them what they need in the field, and that when their service has ended, we will care for them adequately. Breaking that promise is a dishonor to them and their sacrifice, and it is not supporting our troops."" 
   Whitehouse cited recent reports in the Washington Post and Newsweek magazine of mold-infested facilities at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and frustrating bureaucratic hurdles that leave many veterans and their families without the care they need to heal and rebuild their lives.  
   The full text of Whitehouse's remarks, as prepared for delivery, is below. 
   Remarks of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse Supporting Our Veterans March 1, 2007 
   Mr. President, I rise this morning because in recent days, we have learned to our great dismay that this administration has let one of our most sacred promises go unfulfilled. 
   In Rhode Island last week, I visited veterans convalescing at our VA hospital in Providence. On Tuesday, I talked with members of Rhode Island's branch of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), who came to Washington to appeal for those returning from the war in Iraq. 
   And then of course are the many brave veterans I met throughout my state over the past several years - at American Legion posts, at senior centers, at Fourth of July and Memorial Day parades, and at our many community dinners in towns all over Rhode Island. They were men and women, young and old. They had served in our nation's wars from World War II to Vietnam to the conflict in Iraq. And like the DAV members I met yesterday, they wanted us to hear what they had to tell us: the infuriating truth that we are failing to support our troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   When we ask ordinary men and women to do the extraordinary, and stand up and serve in harm's way, we know we can never fully repay what they and their families have given us. But we can surely pledge to them that we will give them what they need in the field, and that when their service has ended, we will care for them adequately. Breaking that promise is a dishonor to them and their sacrifice, and it is not supporting our troops. 
   I believe - as do many of my colleagues - that the best way to support our troops would be to deploy them out of Iraq, and define a more sensible and responsible strategy against terror. Some on the other side of the aisle have claimed our calls for a new strategy in Iraq mean we do not support our troops. This argument is truly horrible, thoroughly false, and shows the depths to which this debate has plummeted. 
   Mr. President, let's judge support for our troops within this chamber and in the Administration by real actions, not inflammatory and phony rhetoric. By that measure, it's fair to question whether the Bush administration and those in this Chamber who support the President's Iraq policy truly understand the needs of America's veterans, the men and women fighting in Iraq, and those who will soon join them as this President escalates the conflict. 
   We want our troops now in Iraq to come home safely. They want to send tens of thousands more there. They have sent them without adequate support personnel, equipment, or armor; and without adequate assurance that, should they be injured in the line of duty, they will be properly cared for when they return. 
   That is not supporting the troops. 
   In America we have the best doctors, nurses, facilities, and medical equipment. From combat medics to VA hospitals, the military can provide our active duty military personnel and veterans with medical care that's second to none. But despite all this, our military and veterans' health care system has a crushing, all-encompassing problem, and that is access to care. 
   When servicemen and women enter the VA system, in too many cases, they begin a long, uphill battle for access to the care and benefits they need to get well and rebuild their lives. The war in Iraq triggered a flood of new veterans that risks overwhelming the VA's system - 700,000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan are expected to enter the military and VA health care systems in the coming years, at a projected cost of as much as $600 billion. 
   According to the Army Times, the number of service members being approved for permanent disability retirement has ""plunged"" by more than two-thirds since 2001. The Army's physical disability caseload has increased by 80 percent since 2001. As it attempts to process new benefits claims in fiscal year 2006, the VA is experiencing a 400,000 case backlog. Veterans frequently wait six months to two years before they begin to receive monthly benefits. 
   These problems are especially acute in the area of mental health. More than 73,000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan treated by the VA since 2002 have been diagnosed with a potential mental disorder; more than 39,000 have been tentatively diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. 35 percent of Iraq veterans have sought psychological counseling within one year of returning home. But where the VA spent over $3,500 per veteran on mental health care in 1995, it spends just over $2,500 today - a drop of close to $1,000 per veteran. 
   These are troubling statistics. But they fail utterly to capture our dismay at the reports, published over the past several days in the Washington Post and Newsweek, of unacceptable living conditions for outpatients at Walter Reed Medical Center and stifling bureaucracy that blockades many veterans' access to care. 
   The Washington Post wrote of soldiers living in Walter Reed facilities infested with mold and mice, unable to get new uniforms to replace those cut from their bodies by military doctors in the field, forced to bring photos and even their own Purple Hearts to prove to file clerks that they served in Iraq. Waiting months as the VA processes benefit claims in what Marine Sgt. Ryan Groves called ""a nonstop process of stalling,"" these soldiers and their families move from appointment to appointment and submit form after form - often to replace earlier forms already lost by the system. Many suffer from brain injuries, PTSD, or other mental health conditions, but Walter Reed's outpatient facilities lack sufficient mental health counselors and social workers to help them navigate the system. 
   The Post tells us many Walter Reed outpatients now face ""teams of Army doctors scrutinizing their injuries for signs of preexisting conditions, lessening their chance for disability benefits."" Veterans often must navigate the convoluted system alone, carrying stacks of medical records from appointment to appointment. The Post quoted Vera Heron, who lived on the post for over a year helping care for her son. ""You are talking about guys and girls whose lives are disrupted for the rest of their lives, and they don't put any priority on it."" 
   Mr. President, the care of our veterans returning home from Iraq should be among our nation's highest priorities. For these soldiers and their families to feel as forgotten and abandoned as they do means, simply, that this administration is not serving them as it should - it is not serving them as they served us. It's not supporting our troops. The Air Force Times just reported that soldiers at Walter Reed have now been told not to speak to the media, and that the Pentagon has: 
   ""clamped down on media coverage of any and all Defense Department medical facilities ... saying in an email to spokespeople: 'It will be in most cases not appropriate to engage the media while this review takes place,' referring to an investigation of the problems at Walter Reed."" 
   The administration cannot, and must not, just bury its failure to support our troops. I commend our Armed Services Committee, including my senior Senator Jack Reed, for that committee's announced hearing on conditions at Walter Reed. I hope they will be relentless in their investigation. 
   Mr. President, my colleagues and the constituents we represent wholeheartedly support our troops and our veterans. Anything else you hear is a lie. We believe it's time for our soldiers to redeploy out of Iraq, because we believe that is our nation's best strategy forward in the Middle East and to combat terror. But we also believe that as they serve and when they get home, we must make good on our promises to train and equip them in their service, and to care for them in their injury and illness. It is our obligation to do this. In the face of all we have heard and seen, that obligation, like so many others, has been failed by this administration.

WHITEHOUSE JOINS NATIONAL ARTS COUNCIL
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) has been appointed to serve as an ex-officio member of the National Council on the Arts, the advisory body to the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). He was named to the Council by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). 
   ""I'm honored to represent the Ocean State on this distinguished panel,"" Whitehouse said. ""The NEA supports Rhode Island artists, performances, and educational opportunities that make our communities richer, our economy stronger, and our lives more meaningful. Our great senator, Claiborne Pell, championed the NEA, and I'm proud to have the opportunity to assist this organization in its important work.""
   The National Council on the Arts serves in an advisory role to the Chairman of the NEA, Dan Gioia, reviewing and making recommendations on grant applications and initiatives. Along with the six ex officio Congressional members, the council consists of 14 people widely recognized for their contribution to the arts. Over the years, members have included Duke Ellington, Leonard Bernstein, Helen Hayes, and John Steinbeck.
   The NEA was created in 1965 with the enactment of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act, signed into law by then-President Lyndon Johnson. The bill was originally sponsored by former Senator Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), a champion of the NEA throughout his life. The agency has repeatedly recognized Rhode Island's contribution to the arts through grants to some of the state's famous artistic institutions, including the Trinity Repertory Company, the Everett Dance Theater, and the Rhode Island School of Design. 
   Rhode Islanders are also taking advantage of the NEA's innovative programs, such as the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence's participation in The Big Read program, which will give residents of the city of Warwick the opportunity to read Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God together.

REED, WHITEHOUSE INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO HELP RHODE ISLAND FEDERAL WORKERS
  In an effort to ensure that Rhode Island's federal employees receive equal pay for equal work, Sens. Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) on Tuesday, March 20, introduced legislation to include Rhode Island in the Boston federal wage area.  
   The Rhode Island Federal Worker Fairness Act of 2007 would merge the Narragansett Bay wage area with the Boston, Massachusetts wage area to provide Rhode Island federal wage workers with pay equity in the region. 
   ""Each year, Rhode Island loses qualified federal workers to Boston and Connecticut due to significant wage disparities,"" stated Reed. ""This raises serious concerns about the fairness and equity of the federal wage pay scales. Federal wage workers perform many important duties and it is essential that they are fairly compensated for their work. I am pleased to introduce this legislation with Senator Whitehouse to ensure that Rhode Island's federal workers receive equal pay for equal work."" 
   ""We're proud of our federal workers and their service to our nation,"" Whitehouse said. ""Bringing their pay in line with others in New England - a 12 percent raise - will help these people and their families continue living and working in Rhode Island."" 
   Rhode Island's federal agencies, currently included in the Narragansett Bay Federal Wage Area, have consistently faced problems with employee recruitment and retention due to proximity to states where wage rates are higher. The average wage grade worker in Rhode Island earns $2 per hour less than the same worker in Boston and $1.50 less than their counterpart in Hartford. 
   Federal wage rates are determined by the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee (FPRAC) which studies the prevailing rate system and reviews wage survey area boundaries based upon commuting patterns and census data. 
   Nearly 80 percent of all Federal Wage System workers in the United States work either in the Department of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs. Naval Station Newport employs most of the nearly 500 federal wage workers in the Narragansett Bay Wage Area. These workers, including janitors, mechanics, machine tool operators, munitions and explosives operators, electricians, and engineers, are paid under one of the lowest Federal Wage System (FWS) regional pay scales in the nation while residing in one of the highest cost-of-living areas.

  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who served as U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island from 1994-1998, voted on Tuesday, March 20, in support of legislation to close the loophole used by the Bush administration as part of its efforts to fire several U.S. Attorneys last year, a move widely criticized as having been motivated by partisan politics rather than genuine concerns over the job performance of the prosecutors involved.  
   ""My experience firmly convinces me that the administration of justice in this country is well-served by a healthy tension between the practical experience of the U.S. Attorneys in the field and the policy direction of the Department of Justice in Washington,"" Whitehouse said. ""When you have a Department of Justice that evaluates U.S. Attorneys on their loyalty to the President and the Attorney General, that is a very serious issue. I join the rest of my colleagues in seeking to get to the bottom of this and restore the independence and integrity of the U.S. Attorney corps and the Department of Justice."" 
   The Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007 (S. 214), which would undo the Bush administration's efforts to allow the Attorney General to make interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, bypassing the Senate confirmation process, passed the Senate today by a vote of 94-2. Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is a cosponsor of the bill and took part in a press conference today with other members of the Judiciary Committee and concerned Senators to discuss next steps forward. 
   S. 214 would require that an interim appointment of a U.S. Attorney made by the Attorney General would expire after 120 days or when a successor is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, whichever comes first. If, after 120 days, no successor has been confirmed, the local district court would have the authority to appoint an interim U.S. Attorney until the vacancy is filled.

WHITEHOUSE BILL, A STEP TO REPAIR POLITICIZATION AT JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, OVERWHELMINGLY PASSES SENATE COMMITTEE
  In a bipartisan, 14-2 vote, the Senate Judiciary Committee today approved legislation authored by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) aimed at restoring a critical safeguard against political interference at the Department of Justice, a step Whitehouse said would help ""restore Americans' confidence"" in the Department in the wake of the controversial tenure of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. 
  The bill, S. 1845, deals with the rules governing communications between the White House and the Department of Justice. During the Clinton administration, a total of only seven people at the White House and the Justice Department were permitted to initiate discussions of ongoing cases or investigations, including the President, Vice President, and Attorney General. Bush administration officials changed that policy, authorizing more than 40 people at the Department and more than 400 people - in a later revision, over 900 - in the White House to initiate such conversations. 
  Whitehouse's legislation would require the Department of Justice and the White House to notify Congress which officials, beyond the original seven, have engaged in such discussions. Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Senator John Cornyn (R-Tex.) have cosponsored the bill.
  ""Political operatives in the White House have no business engaging in sensitive case-specific conversations with Justice Department lawyers. But the Bush administration's current policy allows just that,"" Whitehouse said. ""Even Attorney General Gonzales admitted that the greatest threat to the Department's independence came from the White House, so this portal between the White House and the Department bears careful scrutiny. This bill will help restore Americans' confidence in the administration of justice in this country, while ensuring this and future administrations have the flexibility to address exigencies.""
  Whitehouse, a former U.S. Attorney, questioned Attorney General Gonzales about the revised policy during two Judiciary Committee hearings. Gonzales himself signed a 2006 memorandum further expanding the authority to discuss cases to over 900 people in the executive branch, explicitly including officials within the Office of the Vice President.
  ""What on Earth business does the Office of the Vice President have in the internal workings of the Department of Justice with respect to criminal investigations, civil investigations, ongoing matters?"" Whitehouse asked Gonzales during a July 24 Judiciary Committee hearing. ""As a general matter, I would say that that's a good question,"" the Attorney General responded.
  Gonzales told Whitehouse that ""I would be concerned about inappropriate access to ongoing investigations ? if that's encouraged by this kind of memorandum, I think it's something that we ought to rethink.""

The VA will pay 100 percent of the cost associated with the expansion.

More space is needed to provide a final resting place for our veterans and their spouses and this money will help lay the groundwork to expand the cemetery's capacity,"" said Reed, a member of the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees federal spending on veterans programs. Reed has been working since 2004 to help secure funds for this project and wrote a letter of support to the VA. ""Our veterans have served with great distinction and it is imperative that we honor their sacrifices. This grant will help enhance the final resting place for those who served."" 
  ""The Memorial Cemetery in Exeter is among the most sacred spaces in our state, a place where families, friends, and all of us can gather to remember those who gave so much to our nation in times of war,"" Whitehouse said. Whitehouse wrote to the VA earlier this year asking to be advised when the funds would be released. ""I'm proud that this federal funding will help make these resting grounds a more beautiful, functional place for veterans today and in the future."" 
  The Rhode Island Veterans Cemetery in Exeter spans 265 acres and is one of the most active veterans cemeteries in the country.

WHITEHOUSE AGAIN CALLS FOR AMERICAN TROOPS TO COME HOME
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today strongly questioned the Bush administration's response to British Prime Minister Tony Blair's announcement that United Kingdom troops will begin leaving Iraq in the coming months, and again called on the President to announce the beginning of an American redeployment from Iraq.  
   ""On one hand, President Bush says American troop levels in Iraq need to escalate by tens of thousands, but on the other, he says things are going so well that British troops can safely leave. The President simply cannot have it both ways,"" Whitehouse said. 
   Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, noted that according to an unclassified summary of January's National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) assessing the security situation in Iraq, ""Iraqi society's growing polarization, the persistent weakness of the security forces and the state in general, and all sides' ready recourse to violence are collectively driving an increase in communal and insurgent violence and political extremism."" 
   ""Rhode Islanders are rightfully growing frustrated at this administration's inability - or unwillingness - to be thoughtful and straightforward about its plans for Iraq,"" Whitehouse said. ""With a united voice, we have demanded a new direction, and we have yet to see it.""

WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING HOW HEALTH CARE REFORM CAN LOWER COSTS
  I want first to thank Chairman Conrad for holding this hearing, and for his longstanding interest in the ways in which health care reform can significantly improve America's fiscal outlook for decades to come.
  Our health care system is broken: it yields unsatisfactory results at vast expense. The annual cost of the system exceeds $2 trillion and is expected soon to double. We spend more of our GDP on health care than any other industrialized country. Health care is one of the largest expenses for many of our companies: Starbucks spends more on health care than it does on coffee beans and Ford spends more on it than it does on steel. 
  Yet the number of uninsured Americans is climbing and will soon break 50 million. As many as 100,000 Americans are killed every year by unnecessary and avoidable medical errors. Life expectancy, obesity rates, and infant mortality rates are much worse than they should be, by most international measures. The system itself doesn't work - hospitals are broke, doctors are furious, and paperwork chokes the system. More American families are bankrupted by health care costs than any other cause. 
  I have heard from countless Rhode Islanders who have struggled to pay for their health care, and who live in fear of losing the coverage on which they and their families depend. It does not have to be this way. 
  What we are dealing with, in a nutshell, is market failure: the American health care system does not optimize quality or invest in prevention, particularly where improved care would lower cost; the system does not have the information technology infrastructure to support the improvements we need; and the way we pay for health care sends adverse price signals that steer away from the public interest. 
  Specifically in the area of health information technology, some pretty respectable organizations have looked to see what we would save in health care costs if our health IT infrastructure were adequate. Here's what they report for anticipated savings: 
  * RAND, $81 billion, conservatively;
   * David Brailer, former National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, $100 billion; and
   * The Center for Information Technology Leadership, $77 billion. 
   The average of the three estimates: $86 billion per year. 
  That is a lot of savings to leave sitting out there - savings desperately needed by American businesses and American families. 
  But rather than a focused national effort to capture the savings from health care reform, the system leaves it up to individual doctors and health care providers to choose and implement health IT infrastructure office by office. If you were in business school and you submitted that structure as a business plan for health care reform, you'd not only get an F, you might be asked to reconsider your career path.
  We have work to do in three areas: improving health care quality and prevention in ways that lower costs; fixing our information technology to increase efficiency and generate savings; and repairing the reimbursement system so it does not discourage those reforms, but rather encourages and rewards them. 
  A few weeks ago, I introduced three bills to address these problems. The Quality Reform Expansion and Savings Act of 2007 (S. 1451) would provide grants to local quality reform organizations that are engaged in the real ""R&D"" work on improving care and lowering cost in health care. 
  The National Health Information Technology and Privacy Advancement Act of 2007 (S. 1455) would create a national, private, non-profit corporation to plan, initiate, develop, finance, and manage our national IT infrastructure. I want to note especially that the funding mechanism for this bill allows the corporation to capitalize on the billions of dollars in projected savings for health information technology, raising revenue through user fees, bonds, and other appropriate tools without increasing the deficit. 
  Finally, the Improved Medical Decision Incentive Act of 2007 (S. 1471) would allow doctors and medical specialty groups to apply to their state departments of health with best practices, and to reward them for compliance with such protocols through increased public insurance payments and speedier private payments.
  The system that underlies all our health care financing, coverage, and access problems in this country is itself broken. It is administrative and bureaucratic machinery, and, like other machinery, when it is broken, it needs to be fixed. 
  Fixing the administration of our health care system will reduce costs, improve care, and make a badly-operating system run better. That can move us a critical step forward towards making sure every American family has access to health care they can afford.

WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, on Wednesday, March 21, attended a hearing at which former Vice President Al Gore testified on climate change and the threat of global warming.  
   The full text of Senator Whitehouse's official statement is below. 
   Thank you, Madam Chairman, for convening this hearing, and Mr. Vice President, thank you for your testimony. I can say without reservation or fear of contradiction that two our strongest advocates for the environment sit in this room today, and it is a pleasure to be here with you both. 
   Mr. Vice President, I am proud to be part of a Senate and an Environment and Public Works Committee whose leaders take the threat of climate change as seriously as you do. Thanks in large part to your tireless work, the people of this nation already know much more about climate change than ever before, and are much more deeply engaged in finding solutions. 
   I received a letter recently from Dominic, a 12-year-old boy from South Coventry, Rhode Island. ""I have asthma,"" he wrote, ""so air quality is very important to me."" He wanted our government to do more to curb carbon emissions so that he could grow up breathing clean air. 
   I have joined several of my colleagues on this committee in cosponsoring the Boxer-Sanders legislation to sharply reduce emissions that contribute to global warming, and we intend to keep working hard to make sure the American people understand that this problem is real, is urgent, and is not going away. 
   I come from a state whose 1.1 million residents live less than a 30-minute drive from the water: the Blackstone and Woonsquatucket rivers, our treasured Narragansett Bay, or the Atlantic Ocean itself. The long-term effects of global warming, including the prospect of a dramatic increase in sea levels, could be devastating to Rhode Island and its people. 
   With the help of my state's environmental community, as well as my wife, Dr. Sandra Whitehouse, who is a marine biologist, I made a presentation to this Committee earlier this year that showed clearly what would happen to our Ocean State in the event of a significant rise in sea levels, the nightmare scenario you suggest in ""An Inconvenient Truth."" Newport's historic harbor would be swept away. So would downtown Providence, and coastal communities like Barrington. It would be catastrophic. 
   Recently I joined Chairman Boxer and members of this committee on a congressional visit to New Orleans to see the damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. None of us will ever forget what we saw - and none of us who live in the paths of hurricanes past and future will ever underestimate the threat to lives, communities, and local economies of another major storm. We know that the warming of our world's oceans puts us at greater risk for stronger, deadlier hurricanes, and that taking action today to slow the rate of climate change worldwide could help reduce that risk. 
   Mr. Vice President, you have managed to translate complex science into language every American can understand. Your words have resonated with this Committee and across our country. I thank you for your testimony today, and your willingness to appear.

WHITEHOUSE'S FIRST SENATE BILLS FOCUS ON HEALTH REFORM
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today unveiled his first legislation since taking office in January: a trio of bills grounded in his experience working with health care in Rhode Island and aimed at expanding the use of health information technology and improving the quality of care. 
   ""Over many years, Rhode Islanders have told me they're frustrated at a health care system that costs too much but leaves most people without the care they need,"" Whitehouse said. ""If we can make the system work better for everyone, we can cut costs, save lives, and improve the quality of the health care we receive - a critical step toward ensuring that all Americans have health care they can afford.""  
   America's health care system, Whitehouse said, is beset with several interrelated problems: it emphasizes treatment of illness rather than prevention; better or more efficient procedures are often not standardized nor in widespread use; the system's reliance on paper rather than electronic records slows the exchange of information and frequently contributes to avoidable medical errors; and the ways in which providers are compensated for the care they deliver make all those problems significantly worse. 
   Whitehouse's legislation takes steps to address those problems through three innovative, experience-based proposals: 
   Supporting Health Quality Reform. As Rhode Island's Attorney General, Whitehouse founded the Rhode Island Quality Institute, a collaborative effort between health care providers, insurers, and government that has spearheaded initiatives to expand the use of electronic health records and promote quality-based reforms. Today, many state and local organizations like the Quality Institute are serving as the ""R&D"" arm of our health care industry, gathering data and instituting reforms that are innovative models for improving the system nation-wide. The Quality Reform Expansion and Savings Act of 2007 will help advance these efforts, creating two-year federal grants for local organizations pursuing health quality reform in areas ranging from electronic record-keeping, to early prevention and detection of illness, to efforts to expand health care coverage. 
   Building a National Health IT System. Experts say the widespread adoption of health information technology could reduce dangerous, unnecessary medical errors; cut health care costs; and significantly improve the quality of care Americans receive. But despite the enormous savings potential of health IT, no national infrastructure now exists, and most local health care providers can't afford to build a system from scratch. The National Health Information Technology and Privacy Advancement Act of 2007 will establish a private, non-profit corporation tasked with developing a national, interoperable, secure health information technology system to help bring the extraordinary power of health IT to everyone involved in the health care system. 
   Linking Health Care Costs to Health Care Quality. Today, the system by which health care providers are reimbursed for treating illness rewards them for delivering more care to sicker patients, not preventative care to keep patients healthy. The Improved Medical Decision Incentive Act of 2007 will re-focus our health care reimbursement system on quality by allowing states to establish ""best practice"" guidelines for treating illnesses or conditions. Based on the advice and experience of medical experts in that field, these best practices will reflect treatments or procedures that result in healthier patients and reduced costs to the system. This bill also will provide for safeguards ensuring that health care services following recognized best practices are compensated accordingly.

The amendment to the Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1585) was offered by Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Senator Jack Reed (D-R.I.)

DURBIN, WHITEHOUSE: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS INVESTIGATING TORTURE AUTHORIZATION
  In response to a request by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), the Justice Department has announced it has launched an investigation of the role of top DOJ officials and staff attorneys in authorizing and/or overseeing the use of waterboarding by U.S. intelligence agencies. The investigation is being carried out by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), which is responsible for investigating employees of the DOJ who have been accused of misconduct with respect to their professional functions. 
   ""The United States has always repudiated waterboarding as a form of torture and prosecuted it as a war crime. Justice Department officials who ignored this history - even those at the highest levels - must be held accountable for their actions,"" said Durbin. ""A hard look at DOJ officials who approved waterboarding as a lawful interrogation technique is long overdue and I am pleased that the Office of Professional Responsibility has undertaken this investigation. Congress and the American people deserve to know how these decisions were made and who was involved.""
   ""Within the question, how America could come to use interrogation techniques of the Inquisition, is the question how the Department of Justice could have overlooked its own precedents to authorize waterboarding,"" said Whitehouse, a former U.S. Attorney and Attorney General for Rhode Island. ""This abject failure of scholarship suggests that the answer was preordained and the Department was driven by politics and obedience, not law and independence. I welcome OPR's report in our continuing effort to reclaim DOJ from the 'loyal Bushies' who have besmirched a great institution.""
  In a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, of which Whitehouse is a member, General Michael Hayden, director of the CIA, publicly acknowledged for the first time that the U.S. government had used waterboarding during interrogations of several detainees, including Khalid Sheik Mohammed. Attorney General Michael Mukasey has stated that the Department of Justice advised the intelligence agency that the use of waterboarding would be lawful. 
  In the wake of those statements, Senators Durbin and Whitehouse, who both serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called on the Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate the conduct of Justice Department officials who provided that advice, seemingly in contravention of a significant body of U.S. legal precedent. 
  In response, H. Marshall Jarrett, who heads OPR, wrote the senators that this issue is ""included in a pending OPR investigation into the circumstances surrounding the drafting"" of a 2002 Office of Legal Counsel memo on interrogation standards.

   ""I have heard from countless Rhode Islanders who have struggled to pay for their health care, and who live in fear of losing coverage on which they and their families depend,"" Whitehouse said. ""I've met nurses frustrated and heartbroken that they must spend so much time filling out paperwork, and so little time caring for patients. And I've talked with families whose lives and health were shaken by terrifying medical errors - misplaced paperwork, mistaken diagnoses - that should have been totally avoidable.""

The trio of measures are aimed at encouraging health quality reforms, building a national health IT infrastructure, and linking health care payments to health care quality. 
   In his remarks this morning, Whitehouse noted that the annual cost of the health care system exceeds $2 trillion - a spending level that may soon double - and that America spends 16 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, more than any other industrialized nation and double the average in the European Union. More than 46 million Americans lack health insurance. 
   ""Our current health care system is so complex, and costs so much, yet so often does not provide patients with the quality of care they desperately need,"" Whitehouse said. ""If we can reduce the cost of the underlying system by improving its performance, it will make the solutions easier for financing the system more sensibly and expanding access to all Americans."" 
   Today, Whitehouse plans to introduce the Quality Reform Expansion and Savings Act of 2007, creating two-year federal grants for local organizations pursuing health quality reform in areas ranging from electronic record-keeping, to early prevention and detection of illness, to efforts to expand health care coverage.

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, said Congress should look further into repeated instances in which the Bush administration put politics before science, a subject detailed in a report released today by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). 
   The report documented numerous cases in which work by scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was edited, manipulated, or undermined by Bush administration political appointees. Whitehouse has been an outspoken critic of EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson and the Bush administration's environmental policy.
   ""When EPA's own scientists say Americans can't trust the agency to protect our environment, it is a scathing indictment of the Bush administration's repeated efforts to twist, misuse, and ignore scientific facts in favor of special interests,"" Whitehouse said today.
   ""This report documents case after case after case of political interference in scientific and regulatory decisions, when the final outcome was determined not by what would be best for the environment and the public, but by what the President or his political allies and campaign contributors wanted. Those misplaced priorities have cost this country dearly, and I plan to investigate this issue further in upcoming months as the EPW committee continues its oversight of the Bush administration's politicization of science.""
   The UCS report stated that its investigation showed ""an agency under siege from political pressures."" 60 percent of EPA scientists who responded to a UCS survey reported having personally experienced at least one incident of political interference during the past five years, with hundreds citing situations in which scientists objected to or removed themselves from a project because of pressure to change their findings; changes were made to documents that changed the meaning of scientific findings; or EPA officials misrepresented scientific findings.
   In response to the UCS survey, one scientist at an EPA regional office wrote: ""Do not trust the Environmental Protection Agency to protect your environment.""

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) joined every other Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee today in a letter to Attorney General Michael Mukasey, again urging him to state definitively whether the interrogation technique called ""waterboarding"" is illegal under U.S. law.
   ""Waterboarding is torture, and torture is illegal,"" Whitehouse said today. ""It is ineffective as a method of gathering intelligence, and the failure to condemn its use puts American troops in danger. I asked Judge Mukasey about this matter during his confirmation hearings last fall, and his answer was unsatisfactory. Now that he has had time to study this issue further, I hope he has come to the right conclusion."" 
   During an October 18, 2007 Judiciary Committee hearing on Mukasey's nomination, Whitehouse asked Mukasey: ""Do you have an opinion on whether water-boarding, which is the practice of putting somebody in a reclining position, strapping them down, putting cloth over their faces and pouring water over the cloth to simulate the feeling of drowning - is that constitutional?"" Mukasey replied: ""If it amounts to torture, it is not constitutional."" Mukasey's failure to state definitively that waterboarding is torture led Whitehouse to vote against his nomination.
   In response to a subsequent question by committee Democrats, Attorney General Mukasey wrote on October 30, 2007 that ""if confirmed I will review any coercive interrogation techniques currently used by the United States Government and the legal analysis authorizing their use to assess whether such techniques comply with the law.""
   The full text of the letter, which was initiated by Senate Assistant Majority Leader Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), is below.
   January 23, 2008
   The Honorable Michael Mukasey
  Attorney General
  U.S. Department of Justice
  950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
  Washington, D.C. 20530
   Dear Attorney General Mukasey:
   On October 23, 2007, we wrote to you to ask you whether the abusive interrogation technique known as waterboarding is illegal.
   On October 30, you responded that waterboarding and other abusive techniques ""seem over the line or, on a personal basis, repugnant to me."" You said that you could not offer an opinion on the legality of waterboarding based on ""hypothetical facts and circumstances"" because you had not been briefed on the government's interrogation techniques: ""Legal opinions should treat real issues. I have not been briefed on techniques used in any classified interrogation program conducted by any government agency."" However, you committed that, ""if confirmed I will review any coercive interrogation techniques currently used by the United States Government and the legal analysis authorizing their use to assess whether such techniques comply with the law.""
   You were confirmed as Attorney General on November 8, 2007. On November 9, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham sent you a letter stating, ""The scenarios you previously described as hypothetical are no longer so, and you now have the benefit of full access to classified programs and memoranda. We urge you to acquaint yourself immediately with these matters and take the opportunity to make clear that waterboarding is illegal and can never be employed.""
   It has been over two months since then, ample time for you to study this issue and reach a conclusion. On November 27, State Department Legal Advisor John Bellinger said you were giving ""high priority"" to reviewing interrogation techniques, claiming, ""I think there is a growing recognition ... about the need for greater clarity about what is permitted and what is prohibited.""
   Your failure to say whether waterboarding is legal has placed Judge Mark Filip, the nominee for Deputy Attorney General, in a difficult position. When Judge Filip was asked at his confirmation hearing whether waterboarding was unlawful, he was unwilling to answer because you were studying the issue: ""[T]he Attorney General of the United States is presently reviewing that legal question. \x85 I don't think I can, or anyone who could potentially [be] considered for his deputy, could get out in front of him on that question while it's under review.""
   We are concerned that your silence poses a more serious threat to American servicemembers. As we noted in our October 23rd letter:
   Your unwillingness to state that waterboarding is illegal may place Americans at risk of being subjected to this abusive technique. If the United States does not explicitly and publicly condemn waterboarding, it will be more difficult to argue that enemy forces cannot waterboard American prisoners.
   This concern was highlighted recently during ""The Legal Rights of Guantanamo Detainees: What Are They, Should They Be Changed, and Is an End in Sight?"" a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security on December 11. Brigadier General Thomas Hartmann, Legal Advisor to the Convening Authority for the Office of Military Commissions, refused to say whether it would be legal for the Iranian government to subject an American citizen to waterboarding. He also testified that it is possible that information obtained through waterboarding could be introduced as evidence in a military commission.
   In stark contrast to Brigadier General Hartmann's refusal to say whether it would be illegal to waterboard an American, Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell recently opined that waterboarding would be torture if used against him. According to The New Yorker, DNI McConnell said, ""If I had water draining into my nose, oh God, I just can't imagine how painful! Whether it's torture by anybody else's definition, for me it would be torture.""
   Please respond to the following questions:
   1. Is the use of waterboading as an interrogation technique illegal under U.S. law, including treaty obligations?
   2. Based on your review of other coercive interrogation techniques and the legal analysis authorizing their use, what is your assessment of whether such techniques comply with the law?
   Thank you for your time and consideration.

WHITEHOUSE VOTES TO PASS BUDGET THAT FUNDS AMERICA'S PRIORITIES
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today joined a majority of the Senate to pass a budget that forestalls deep cuts proposed by President Bush and increases funding for critical national priorities such as health care for children and veterans. Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 passed this afternoon by a vote of 52-47.  
   ""The Senate passed a budget that puts the needs of working families first,"" Whitehouse said. ""The budget proposed by the President serves the wealthiest Americans at the expense of those who need our help the most. Today, the Senate reordered those priorities so we can begin to set our country on a better course."" 
   The Senate budget allocates a total of $50 billion over five years for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) - 25 times more than under the President's plan - and significant funding increases for education and veterans' health care. It reduces the federal deficit over time to reach a balanced budget by 2012. 
   Whitehouse is a member of the Senate Budget Committee. During the committee's consideration of the budget resolution last week, Whitehouse and Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) successfully offered a bipartisan measure creating a deficit-neutral reserve fund to support the adoption of modern health information technology and accepted best practices in clinical settings. Reserve funds allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to adjust the budget resolution when certain legislation is passed, to accommodate revenue and spending levels included in the bill.

WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON EPA'S AUTHORITIES TO CURB GLOBAL WARMING
  We're here today for two troubling reasons. We're here because global warming, as our chair recognizes so clearly, is a serious and urgent problem that we have to address in our communities, our states, and our nation. But we're also here because the decision handed down in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency reflects yet another instance of a disturbing legal trend: courts having to force EPA to do its job. 
   The Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA represents a major step forward to reduce automotive greenhouse gas emissions. As you know, Administrator Johnson, the ruling made clear that EPA does, in fact, have the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate vehicle CO2 emissions, contrary to the Agency's insistence otherwise. I hope this will compel your Agency not only to recognize its authority but also to act on it.  
   Furthermore, in issuing its opinion, the Court removed any remaining excuse your Agency has for failing to approve long-overdue waiver requests allowing Rhode Island and ten other states to set more stringent vehicle emissions standards than currently required under federal law. EPA's years of legal stonewalling, by delaying the implementation of these standards, have allowed millions of tons of carbon dioxide pollution into our air and made it more difficult making to reverse the effects of climate change. 
   Make no mistake, climate change is already having a distressing effect on Rhode Island's treasured coastal environment and our communities. The annual mean winter temperature in Narragansett Bay has increased significantly over the past 20 years, causing changes to the ecosystem such as a reduction in abundance of winter flounder, a species that thrived in the past. Predicted sea level rise will endanger many parts of the Rhode Island coastline. Just last week, the Ocean State was struck by a nor'easter that devastated our shoreline. Coastal erosion is not a new phenomenon for us, but if global warming continues to worsen, the damage will only increase. 
   There's also a larger problem. EPA's track record in court during the Bush Administration is that weak public health protections have been overturned time and time again - or EPA has conceded illegal action. Consider these examples: three air toxics rulemakings in the past month alone; a national smog rulemaking especially important to downwind communities in Rhode Island and the rest of New England; and another significant air pollution loophole that the Court said was sensible only in a ""Humpty Dumpty"" world. The courts have even begun rebuking EPA for defying the law - reminding EPA of the proper way to appeal cases, for example, or what political considerations it must ignore when it carries out the Clean Air Act. 
   As Rhode Island's Attorney General, I joined other A.G.s from nine other North East states in suing the Bush Administration for the pollution emitted by power plants in the Midwest. Prevailing winds blow pollution from Midwest power plants onto us in Rhode Island. The ozone pollution from the Midwest is so bad that even if we stopped all our in-state emissions entirely, we would still fail federal ozone standards due to pollution traveling from other states. We needed to go to court to demand that the Bush Administration be fair to New England and to enforce its own laws against big business interests. 
   EPA's refusal to carry out the duties already conferred upon it by Congress raises real questions about this administration's commitment to protecting the people of this country and its environment against harmful pollution. I look forward to learning more today about the steps EPA is taking to reconsider its decision and allow states like Rhode Island to move forward with efforts to curb the harmful effect of greenhouse gas emissions.

  With November's elections drawing closer, several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee expressed concern today that the Department of Justice has failed to enforce a landmark law designed to help Americans register to vote.  
   In a letter to Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey, U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), Russ Feingold (D-WI), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Dick Durbin (D-IL) noted that DOJ has vigorously enforced statutes that remove voters from the rolls, while refusing to enforce those that aim to expand voter registration. The senators asked Mukasey to specify how DOJ plans to step up enforcement of statutes meant to facilitate registration before the voter registration deadlines for the fall elections.
   ""Simply put, non-compliance with Section 7 is depriving low-income citizens of an important opportunity to participate in the democratic process,"" the senators wrote. 
   64 million Americans - nearly a third of eligible voters - were not registered to vote in 2006, up from 52 million ten years earlier. Section 7 of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), enacted in 1993 to reduce barriers to registration, requires states to make voting registration materials available to people applying or reapplying for Medicaid, food stamps, and other public assistance benefits. This requirement is in addition to the well-known ""Motor Voter"" provision, under which citizens must have the opportunity to register to vote when applying for or renewing a driver's license.
   But while voter registration at state public assistance agencies declined by 79 percent between 1995-96 and 2005-06, the Justice Department, whose Voting Section is responsible for enforcing states' compliance with NVRA, has brought only one lawsuit to enforce this provision of the statute in the last eight years. In contrast, the Department has been much more aggressive in enforcement actions under Section 8 of NVRA, which governs the purging of voter rolls. 
   ""Since 2000, the Department has brought at least five cases against states and municipalities under Section 8, while paying comparatively little attention to Section 7,"" the senators wrote. ""This creates the impression, whether founded or not, that the Department is more concerned with removing names from the voter rolls than adding them."" 
   The senators noted that enforcement of Section 7 has great potential to expand opportunities for low-income Americans to register to vote. Following DOJ's single Section 7 suit, against the state of Tennessee in 2002, the number of voter registration applications filed through public assistance agencies jumped from less than 50,000 in 1999-2000 to more than 170,000 in 2003-04. By the following year, nearly 20 percent of all public assistance registrations in the entire country took place in Tennessee.

WHITEHOUSE SAYS
  As Senate leaders negotiate legislation aimed at bolstering the country's weakening economy, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today urged them not to overlook older Americans, who are especially hard hit by the rising cost of living. Whitehouse is a member of the Senate committees on Aging and the Budget. 
   ""Troubles in the housing market, high home energy prices in a bitterly cold winter, and the rising cost of badly-needed prescription drugs force seniors in my state, and across America, to stretch already severely limited incomes even farther,"" Whitehouse wrote Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). ""I encourage you to include in the stimulus package an alternative mechanism to channel funds to senior citizens.""
   Rising costs have already made making ends meet difficult for many Americans. This year, an estimated 17.8 million Americans are in families that will spend more than 25 percent of their pre-tax income on health care costs. The price of gasoline in Rhode Island is hovering around $3 a gallon, and as of December, a gallon of home heating oil cost an average of $3.29 in New England.
   With many Americans already grappling with sharp increases in day-to-day costs, rising foreclosure rates and turmoil in the mortgage securities markets have worsened the threat of a recession that could severely impact quality of life for low- and middle-income families. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in 2005 a record 37.3 million American households spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing-related expenses, including rent or mortgage payments, utilities, property insurance, and property taxes. The Center for Responsible Lending has projected that an alarming one out of five subprime mortgages made during 1998-2006 will fail, which could result in 2.4 million foreclosures.
   Democrats in Congress are working to assemble an economic stimulus package that will provide fast relief to Americans in need. In his letter to Senators Reid and McConnell, Whitehouse suggested that ""[b]ecause the primary sources of income for most senior citizens are Social Security benefits and savings \x85 One possible mechanism for covering the elderly would be a temporary increase in Social Security benefits."" More than 190,000 Rhode Islanders received Social Security benefits in 2005, the last year for which data is available. Social Security beneficiaries represented 92.4 percent of Rhode Islanders aged 65 and older.

  A Riverside man whose struggles with the health care system demonstrate the need for improved health care quality and information technology will attend President Bush's State of the Union Address next week as the guest of U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). Mike Tracy, a cancer survivor, will fly to Washington Monday afternoon and watch the President's speech from the visitors' gallery of the House of Representatives. 
  ""The victims of medical errors and poor health information technology aren't just statistics - they're people like Mike, and hundreds of thousands of others,"" Whitehouse said. ""If he'd had the benefit of better procedures and an integrated health information technology system, Mike's life could be very different today. I've asked President Bush to significantly increase federal funding for health IT, and I hope he will commit to that on Monday."" 
  Mike Tracy suffered from a misdiagnosed case of squamous cell carcinoma on his foot. His cancer therefore went untreated for several years, and he was told his leg would have to be amputated to prevent the cancer from spreading. After he sought a second opinion at a Boston hospital, his final diagnosis had to be delayed by several weeks in order for his complete records to be transferred from Providence. His amputation surgery was eventually successful and Mike now uses a prosthetic limb. Fortunately, he has been cancer-free since his surgery, but struggled financially for several years with health care premiums so high they exceeded his monthly mortgage payments.
  ""A mistaken diagnosis changed my life forever. Paper medical records meant I had to wait in limbo - knowing my life was in danger - while my chart was transferred from one hospital to another. Nobody should have to go through an experience like this,"" said Tracy. ""We need to fix the health care system.""
  A fully-interoperable, nationwide health information infrastructure could drastically improve patient care, by giving doctors on-the-spot information and data to support diagnoses and other decisions; preventing avoidable medical errors; connecting doctors, pharmacies, and hospitals to allow medical records to be transferred electronically; and allowing health care facilities to track inpatients' recovery progress. Conservative estimates of possible savings from a national health information technology system reach into the tens of billions of dollars. 
  Despite the potential benefits, a lack of investment has slowed progress towards a nationwide, interoperable health IT system. For fiscal year 2008, the Bush administration requested only $118 million - a fraction of the potential savings - in funding for the Office of the National Coordinator, the agency within the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) that coordinates the federal government's health information technology efforts. A sizable increase of this funding could help speed the development of a national health IT system.
  Earlier this month, Whitehouse wrote to President Bush asking that he increase federal funding for health information technology in next year's budget. The founder of the Rhode Island Quality Institute, a leader in the state's efforts to improve health care quality and health information technology utilization, Whitehouse has also introduced Senate legislation to establish a private, non-profit corporation tasked with developing a national, interoperable, secure health IT system (S. 1455).

""Over the past few years, we have seen those traditions systematically destroyed or degraded, and the Attorney General must be held responsible. For America to regain its faith and confidence in our federal justice system, it's time for this Attorney General to go.""

WHITEHOUSE, REED WIN SUPPORT FOR ESTUARY HABITAT RESTORATION
  Congress today passed legislation championed by U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) to support the restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems in Rhode Island and across the country, the senators announced. 
   The Estuary Restoration Act (ERA) passed as part of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), a bipartisan bill that authorizes nearly $21 billion for essential flood control, navigation, and ecosystem restoration projects.
   A member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, Whitehouse worked with Chairman Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) to ensure that the estuaries measure would be included in WRDA.  Once the Senate passed the original legislation, Reed and Whitehouse also wrote to Boxer in early July to stress that the House-Senate conference committee's report on the final bill should preserve the estuary restoration program.
   ""We have seen what unchecked development combined with more severe storms can do to vital coastal regions,"" said Whitehouse.  ""Restoring estuarine and coastal ecosystems is one important way we can preserve our environment and our communities.  I'm proud that Congress has made this critical investment, and pleased to have worked with my senior senator, Jack Reed, to accomplish this.""
   ""I am pleased that Congress has taken this important step to help restore the Ocean State's waterways. Narragansett Bay is one of the many estuaries that play a crucial role in protecting our environment and bolstering the economy.  It is imperative that we conserve our coastal habitats and natural treasures for future generations of Rhode Islanders, and we're fortunate to have Senator Whitehouse as a voice on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee,"" said Reed.
   Estuaries like Narragansett Bay are essential to the health of coastal environments and economies, serving as natural barriers and helping insulate fragile ecosystems and coasts from flood waters.  The serious threats of climate change and potential sea level rise underscore the importance of restoring estuarine habitats, which can make coastlines more resilient to storm surges.  Estuary restoration benefits local economies, supporting recreational activities and preserving unique coastal cultures.  At least 75 percent of commercially and recreationally valuable fish species spend part of their lives in estuaries and coastal wetlands.
   The ERA authorizes $2.5 million annually in dedicated funding for restoration projects whose federal funding share is less than $1 million.  Four agencies, led by the Army Corps of Engineers, constitute the federal Estuary Restoration Interagency Council: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Resources Conservation Service.  Past projects undertaken by the Interagency Council include restoration of salt marshes, mudflats, wetlands, and other important coastal ecologies.
   ""Once again, the hard work and persistence of Senators Reed and Whitehouse will help make a difference in the health and future of Narragansett Bay and its watershed,"" said Save The Bay Executive Director Curt Spalding. ""Reauthorization of the Water Resources Development Act preserves vital funding for estuary restoration. That means money for projects that can have both immediate and long-range impacts when it comes to protecting and fortifying our rivers, streams and wetlands. The people who do this work, as well as the people who benefit from it are grateful for the senators' leadership.""

REED, WHITEHOUSE SEEK TO PROTECT WETLANDS IN RHODE ISLAND, NATIONWIDE
  In an effort to protect Rhode Island's wetlands and rivers and strengthen our nation's environmental laws, U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today joined with Russ Feingold (D-WI) and several Senate colleagues in introducing the Clean Water Restoration Act. This bill will help protect wetlands and other aquatic ecosystems, which play an important role in absorbing flood-waters, preventing pollution from reaching our rivers and streams, and providing crucial habitat for birds, fish, shellfish and other wildlife.  
  Last summer, in a controversial 4-1-4 split decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the landmark Clean Water Act of 1972 only protects ""navigable"" waters, not watersheds feeding navigable waters. This ruling would shrink the pool of water and wetland areas under federal protection and lead to increased litigation. It would also shift more of the cost and burden of safeguarding wetlands to state and local governments. 
  The Clean Water Restoration Act puts Congress clearly on record saying that the intent of the law is to protect all of the nation's waters, including wetlands, streams, tributaries, rivers, ponds, and lakes.
  ""Our communities depend on safe, clean water and for over three decades the Clean Water Act has safeguarded them. This legislation reaffirms and upholds the intent of the Clean Water Act: to establish and maintain the biological and physical integrity of our nation's waters,"" said Reed, a key member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior who cosponsored similar legislation in the last Congress. ""Rhode Island has always been a leader in conserving our natural resources. This bill will extend protections to ensure the health of more ecosystems across the nation.""
  ""The waters of the Ocean State are among our greatest treasures, and the Clean Water Act has defended them from polluters for more than three decades,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. ""This legislation will help ensure Rhode Island's precious marine environment, and waters around the country, remain healthy for generations into the future."" 
  The Clean Water Restoration Act will:
  * Make it clear that the full range of wetlands, streams, lakes, and other waters are protected by the Clean Water Act;
  * Delete the term ""navigable"" from the Clean Water Act to clarify that Congress's primary intent in 1972 is not to limit clean water protection to navigable waters, but to protect all of the nation's waters from pollution; and 
  * Affirm the Constitutional authority of Congress to regulate the nation's waters and wetlands so that our waterways will be protected by federal law.

   Last week, Whitehouse cosponsored and voted for an amendment, offered by Senator Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) and supported by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), to require the President to redeploy virtually all American troops from Iraq by March 31, 2008. The Feingold-Reid measure would have ended funding for the war, with a few narrow exceptions, on that date. 
   Today the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on which Whitehouse serves, released a report evaluating what the nation's intelligence agencies told the Bush administration in the days leading up to the war about the possibility that Al Qaeda or other extremists groups might gain a foothold in a fragile, newly-liberated Iraq. The sobering report found that the administration did not heed warnings from the intelligence community that an American military presence in Iraq could destabilize the country. 
   In a statement of ""additional views,"" Whitehouse joined committee chairman John D. Rockefeller (D-W.V.) and others to note that prior to the war, the intelligence community cautioned that ""the American invasion would bring about instability in Iraq that would be exploited by Iran and al-Qa'ida terrorists,"" a warning the senators called ""chilling and prescient."" 
   ""These pre-war cautions were marginalized if not ignored by an Administration set on going to war,"" the senators wrote. ""In doing so, the Bush Administration once again demonstrated its practice of cherry-picking intelligence reports and assessments that supported policy objectives and denigrating or dismissing those that did not."" 
   Among the important conclusions contained in the report: 
   * The Intelligence Community assessed prior to the war that establishing a stable democratic government in postwar Iraq would be a long, difficult and probably turbulent challenge. 
   * The Intelligence Community assessed prior to the war that al Qa'ida probably would see an opportunity to accelerate its operational tempo and increase terrorist attacks during and after a U.S.-Iraq war. 
   * The Intelligence Community assessed prior to the war that Iraq was a deeply divided society that likely would engage in violent conflict unless an occupying power prevented it. 
   * The Intelligence Community assessed prior to the war that the United States' defeat and occupation of Iraq probably would result in a surge of political Islam and increased funding for terrorist groups. 
   * The Intelligence Community assessed prior to the war that Iranian leaders would try to influence the shape of post-Saddam Iraq to preserve Iranian security and demonstrate that Iran is an important regional actor. 
   * The Intelligence Community assessed prior to the war that military action to eliminate Iraqi WMD [weapons of mass destruction] would not cause other regional states to abandon their WMD programs, or their desire to develop such programs.

  On Friday, May 25, Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-NY), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) asked Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to reveal what he knew about inappropriate, unethical and possibly illegal hiring practices occurring at the Justice Department under his watch.  
   Earlier this week, Monica Goodling, a former Justice Department aide and White House liaison, admitted in testimony before the before the House Judiciary Committee that she ""crossed the line"" in considering political ideology when interviewing applicants for career attorney positions, even going so far as researching political campaign contributions. 
   The Senators sent their questions to the Attorney General in a letter released today, which is reproduced below. 
   The Honorable Alberto R. Gonzalez Attorney General of the United States U.S. Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20530-0001 
   Dear Attorney General Gonzales: 
   Yesterday, the House Judiciary Committee heard testimony from your former senior aide, Ms. Monica M. Goodling. Her testimony raised a number of serious questions concerning the inner workings of the Department of Justice. 
   Ms. Goodling admitted that the Justice Department, under your watch, ""crossed the line"" by routinely using political considerations in the hiring of career attorneys, judges and other non-political staff. 
   Indeed, she stated that she had regularly asked political questions of applicants for career positions, even going so far as researching potential employees' campaign contributions. 
   It appears that the implementation of such political litmus tests was an open secret at the Department. Former officials have testified that they heard rumors to that effect, and the Washington Post yesterday reported that concerns about Ms. Goodling's behavior were raised directly with your former Chief of Staff, D. Kyle Sampson. 
   These facts raise troubling questions about your role in this unprecedented politicization of the Justice Department, among them the following: 
   When, if ever, did you become aware that improper political considerations, such as party affiliation, were possibly being used in the hiring of career staff? 
   Who else in the Department of Justice was aware that politics were at play in the hiring of career staff? 
   Did anyone at any time bring to your attention concerns about improper political considerations being used? If so, who did so and when? What concrete steps did you take, if any, to address this issue and when? We hope that you will quickly and publicly answer these very serious questions. 
   Sincerely, 
   CHARLES E. SCHUMER DIANNE FEINSTEIN SHELDON WHITEHOUSE.

WHITEHOUSE TO NEW ORLEANS: WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN YOU
  Vibrant coastal cities from Louisiana to Rhode Island are still at great risk from major natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina unless we strengthen the infrastructure that shields them, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said today.  
   Whitehouse traveled to New Orleans with Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and a delegation of members of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee for a field hearing to study comprehensive approaches to coastal wetlands restoration, hurricane and storm damage protection, and debris waste management following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Senator Mary Landrieu (D-La.), who chairs the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery, joined the committee for its review. 
   Whitehouse also took part in a Blackhawk helicopter flyover of neighborhoods damaged by the storm and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects to upgrade flood and storm protection systems. The aerial tour began at Jackson Barracks and traveled over St. Bernard Parish, the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet (MRGO), the Lower 9th Ward, and the outfall canals at Orleans Avenue, 17th Street, and London Avenue. 
   ""We came to New Orleans with this message: we have not forgotten you,"" Whitehouse said, after noting that President Bush failed to even mention Katrina or New Orleans in this year's State of the Union Address. ""This morning, we flew over neighborhoods that were completely destroyed - and today have yet to be rebuilt. I would hate to think of neighborhoods in Rhode Island looking like what I have seen today, nearly a year and a half after a storm. We have an obligation to rebuild devastated cities and maintain facilities that protect them. And we need to get this right, so our coastal cities in Rhode Island and throughout the nation never again experience the devastation I witnessed today."" 
   The Committee hearing was held in the Louisiana Supreme Court building on Royal Street in downtown New Orleans. Witnesses included Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) John Paul Woodley; General Don Riley, Army Corps of Engineers; and Richard Green, Environmental Protection Agency Region 6; as well as Louisiana officials and environmental justice advocates. 
   In his opening statement Whitehouse noted that Rhode Island has itself experienced major hurricanes, and remains vulnerable to rising sea levels from storm surges and climate change. Last month, at EPW's first hearing, Whitehouse delivered a presentation on the potential impact of global warming on Rhode Island, including visual demonstrations of the effect a 20-foot rise in sea level could have in Providence, Newport, and Barrington.

  In an effort to help the Rhode Island state government improve service delivery to Medicaid patients and reduce bureaucracy, Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will award the state of Rhode Island $725,253 to update and upgrade its information technology systems.  
   The Medicaid ""IT Infrastructure Transformation grant"" will be used to help the state improve their record-keeping and efficiency to help improve health care for thousands of low-income, elderly, and disabled Rhode Islanders. Rhode Island is one of 27 states receiving this federal funding, which was provided in the fiscal year 2005 budget. 
   ""I am pleased that Rhode Island has received this federal funding to help improve its health care technology,"" said Reed, a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee. ""This money will allow the state to provide better quality care in a more efficient, effective, and less costly manner. Dealing with complicated health care forms and bureaucracy can be a real headache. This IT grant will go a long way toward ensuring that Medicaid-eligible Rhode Islanders can get the information and the care they need, when they need it."" 
   Last summer Senator Reed authored legislation to provide funding to establish a commission to assess how new technologies can improve the health care system for our nation's seniors and reduce costs. 
   ""Too many of the doctors and nurses I've met in Rhode Island feel they spend more time filling out paperwork than caring for patients,"" said Whitehouse. ""Better health information technology can mean less bureaucracy and red tape, fewer dangerous medical errors, lower costs, and higher-quality care. Our state has been a leader in the use of health information technology, and I'm delighted that this grant will help further our efforts.""

The Rhode Island Quality Institute, an organization Whitehouse founded during his tenure as the state's Attorney General, is among the organizations leading the state's ongoing efforts to improve and expand its use of health information technology.

SCHUMER, FEINSTEIN, FEINGOLD, WHITEHOUSE CALL SOLICITOR GENERAL TO APPOINT COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL PERJURY BY ATTORNEY GENERAL
  Today, Senators Charles E. Schumer (D-NY), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Russell Feingold (D-WI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) called for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate possible wrongdoing by the Attorney General, originating with his statements regarding the removal and replacement of several United States Attorneys, in addition to his testimony before Congress regarding the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP.) In a letter to Paul D. Clement, Solicitor General and Acting Attorney General responsible for matters where Attorney General Gonzales has recused himself, the senators called for a special counsel to be appointed to examine the Attorney General's statements on the U.S. Attorney scandal, his testimony before Congress regarding the TSP, and potential charges of obstruction of justice, false statements, and perjury. 
  Earlier this week, Attorney General Gonzales testified before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in a Department of Justice Oversight hearing. During questioning by several members of the Committee, the Attorney General gave statements in conflict with his prior testimony before Congress. Previously, Gonzales had testified that there had not been any ""serious disagreement"" within the Administration regarding a domestic warrantless wiretapping program known as the TSP. That notion was sharply refuted in testimony by former Deputy Attorney General James Comey, who recounted a disagreement so intense that it almost led to his resignation, as well as that of John Ashcroft, Attorney General at the time. In his testimony this week, Gonzales contradicted himself by admitting that there had in fact been a dispute between the White House-where he was Counsel at the time-and the Justice Department over the TSP.
  Additionally, a number of the Attorney General's answers were in direct conflict with accounts from members of Congress and the Administration. Specifically, the Attorney General responded that TSP was not discussed at a March 10, 2004 briefing, despite a letter from John Negroponte, former Director of National Intelligence, indicating that the TSP was in fact the subject of that briefing. Testimony by CIA Director Michael Hayden also confirms that the TSP was discussed at the March 10 briefing. 
  ""Once again, Attorney General Gonzales has proven himself unable to answer a few simple and straightforward questions,"" Schumer said. ""He has now also given testimony that directly contradicts accounts by other Administration officials and members of Congress. The time has come for the Department of Justice to appoint an independent special counsel-someone in the mold of Patrick Fitzgerald-to clean up the mess that the Department of Justice has become under this Attorney General.""
  ""It is with great sadness that we come here today to call for an independent special prosecutor to determine whether Attorney General Gonzales may have misled Congress or perjured himself in testimony before Congress,"" Feinstein said. ""Americans look to their Attorney General to be above reproach, independent, and free from political influence. They want a straight shooter, who will enforce the law no matter what. But Alberto Gonzales has turned this office on its head.""
  ""As the highest ranking law enforcement officer in the country, the Attorney General has a special duty to be truthful and fully forthcoming with Congress,"" Feingold said. In his testimony, the Attorney General has demonstrated a clear pattern of intentionally misleading Congress about Deputy Attorney General James Comey and internal disputes within the administration. A special counsel is needed to look into the litany of misleading statements the Attorney General has made and determine whether criminal charges are warranted.""
  ""The Attorney General's testimony this week left me no choice but to believe that the Senate, and the American people, were being misled about a matter of grave importance to our national security,"" Whitehouse said. ""For the Bush administration to continue to assert that it is above the law is simply unacceptable. We're calling for a special counsel because we need an independent, impartial investigation to determine exactly what's happened here, and to ensure accountability.""
  In this particular situation, where wrongdoing may have occurred at the highest echelons of the Department's management, an outside special counsel is particularly important to ensure an independent and even-handed investigation. 
  In 2003, Senator Schumer was the first person to call for a special counsel to be appointed in the Valerie Plame leak investigation. As a direct consequence, Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed Special Prosecutor, ultimately resulting in the indictment and conviction of former Chief of Staff to the Vice President, Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby.

WHITEHOUSE: VOTE TO PROTECT WORKERS' FREEDOM TO ORGANIZE
  For more than one hundred years, organized labor has been a strong voice, and a powerful advocate, for the working men and women of America in their fight for fair treatment, safe workplaces, and honest pay for an honest day's work. But in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for workers to organize and gain that voice. 
   Today, the Senate has an important opportunity to begin to reverse this trend: by voting in support of the Employee Free Choice Act, which takes several critical steps to ensure that all American workers have the right to form and join a union.
   When a majority of workers wish to organize, they should have that right. This legislation would require the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to certify a bargaining representative if a majority of the employees sign authorization cards. The bill would also direct the NLRB to issue guidelines for selecting a bargaining representative via majority sign-up - including model language for authorization cards and procedures to verify the validity of authorization cards. 
   Newly-formed unions shouldn't face stalemates and stall tactics as they advocate for their members. The Employee Free Choice Act would set a waivable timeline for reaching a first contract agreement once a representative has been certified and bargaining has commenced. Parties would be required to meet and begin bargaining no later than ten days after receiving a written request from the newly certified bargaining representative. 
   And this bill would strengthen existing penalties for unfair labor practices, making it easier for workers to organize without fear of reprisal or backlash. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act is good for American workers - and for our economy. As a group, union members make 30 percent more per week than their non-union counterparts. They are 63 percent more likely to have health insurance, and they are a staggering 386 percent more likely to have a guaranteed pension. At a time of growing income inequality, when everyday families in this country are stretched to the limit just to afford health care, or the mortgage, or gas to drive to work and to school, we can't let this opportunity slip by. The Senate must pass this bill.
   The Employee Free Choice Act would allow workers to choose a union without fear, facilitate contract negotiations, and prevent the anti-organizing scare tactics that, unfortunately, still exist today. 
   Mr. President, the Employee Free Choice Act is the first step towards realizing the dream of fairness for every American worker. I am proud to support this legislation, I ask my colleagues to do the same, and I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE CONTINUES FIGHT TO REPAIR FLAWS IN MEDICARE DRUG PROGRAM
  Over lunch with North Providence seniors today, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Committee on Aging, announced he has cosponsored a pair of bills designed to correct serious flaws in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. 
  ""I've met so many Rhode Island seniors who struggle to pay for the prescription drugs they need,"" said Whitehouse. ""Between the Bush administration's misplaced priorities and big drug companies out to protect their sky-high profits, we have an uphill battle to fight to make the Part D program work better for seniors.  
  ""Empowering Medicare to offer its own drug coverage plans and negotiate for lower drug prices are common-sense fixes that will lower seniors' costs and give them added peace of mind. I'll keep fighting to ensure all seniors have the drug coverage they need and deserve.""
  Under the Medicare Part D program, enacted in 2003, drug coverage for seniors is available only through private insurers. The enormous array of choices offered by these private plans - 51 in Rhode Island alone this year - can prove difficult for seniors to navigate. Nationwide, 73 percent of seniors think the Medicare prescription drug benefit is ""too complicated."" 60 percent agree that ""Medicare should select a handful of plans that meet certain standards, so seniors have an easier time choosing.""
  Whitehouse has cosponsored legislation that would give seniors a choice they could depend on to put their needs first - not a corporate bottom line. The Medicare Prescription Drug Savings and Choice Act of 2007 (S. 2219), introduced by Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), would direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to create one or more Medicare-operated drug plans that could compete with existing private prescription drug plans.
  Today, a standard private Part D drug plan is required to pay 75 percent of a beneficiary's annual drug costs up to $2,400, following a $265 deductible. Once costs exceed $2,400, seniors must pay the entire cost of their prescription drugs, until their spending reaches $5,451 for the year, when coverage resumes. The gap, known as the ""doughnut hole,"" forces seniors to spend as much as $3,850 out of pocket for prescription drugs.
  Under current law, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating with drug companies for lower prescription drug prices. The Center for Economic and Policy Research found that the Veterans Administration, which does have this negotiating power, pays an average of 70 percent less for prescription drugs than Medicare does. The Center also found that the cost to taxpayers of maintaining a private Medicare drug benefit (rather than one administered directly by Medicare, as S. 2219 would provide), combined with Medicare's inability to negotiate lower prices, reaches as much as $30 billion per year.
  To solve this problem, Whitehouse cosponsored the Prescription Drug Gap Reduction Act of 2007 (S. 2089). Introduced by Senator Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), S. 2089 would direct the Secretary of HHS to negotiate for lower drug prices with manufacturers on behalf of more than 40 million Medicare Part D beneficiaries, applying the savings towards filling the doughnut hole in the current program. 
  At today's lunch meeting, held at the Salvatore Mancini Senior Resource Center, Whitehouse argued that seniors in Rhode Island and throughout the country shouldn't be asked to bear the burden of higher costs. Allowing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies would bring drug costs down and help eliminate the doughnut hole, he said.

A list of those whose mail was returned ""undelivered"" is then used as the basis for challenges to the right of those citizens to vote, on the grounds that the voter does not live at the address where he or she is registered. Of course, there are many reasons that mail could be returned undelivered, for example; an eligible voter could be overseas on active military service or a student lawfully registered at a parent's address.
   ""It is an unfortunate reality that, with so much at stake in the ballot box, organized efforts to suppress the vote go nearly as far back as the right to vote itself,"" said Whitehouse, a former United States Attorney, Rhode Island Attorney General, and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""Protecting the rights of eligible voters is essential to the health of our democracy.""
   There is evidence that caging lists were assembled in Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania during the 2004 elections, possibly intended as the basis for massive voter eligibility challenges. The Florida incident made headlines again earlier this year during Congress's investigation into the firing of several U.S. Attorneys, when allegations resurfaced that Tim Griffin, the former RNC opposition researcher then serving as an interim U.S. Attorney in Arkansas, had been involved in an effort to cage voters in Jacksonville. Last June, Whitehouse and Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) called for a Justice Department investigation into allegations that Griffin and others at the RNC may have engaged in caging during the 2004 elections.
   Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who chairs the Rules Committee, is a cosponsor of the Caging Prohibition Act and scheduled the hearing to consider the bill. Other cosponsors include Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), John Kerry (D-Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.). To date, the bill has also been endorsed by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and People for the American Way.

WHITEHOUSE APPLAUDS SENATE APPROVAL FOR HATE CRIMES LEGISLATION
  The U.S. Senate today approved a measure cosponsored by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) to give local law enforcement stronger tools to prosecute hate crimes. The Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crime Prevention Act of 2007 (S. 1105) expands the federal hate crimes statute to include sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and disability status. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has documented more than 114,000 hate crimes since 1991. 
   ""Crimes of hate are unacceptable and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" said Whitehouse, a former Rhode Island Attorney General who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""I'm proud to support this effort to protect more Americans and end these crimes of bias forever."" 
   The Matthew Shepard Act is named for the 21-year-old Wyoming man whose brutal murder in 1998 brought new national attention to crimes of hate. The bill would give local law enforcement officials important tools, like training or direct assistance, to combat crimes that show evidence of prejudice based on sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability status; and encourage Americans to report hate crimes, through increased public education and awareness. 
   The bill also would allow local prosecutors to pursue bias-motivated crime under federal law in areas in which state statutes are inadequate. Currently, only 27 states and Washington, D.C. classify gender-based crimes as hate crimes; 31 states and Washington, D.C. include sexual-orientation based crimes; and only 31 states and Washington, D.C. include disability-based crimes. Rhode Island General Law ? 12-19-38 provides for stronger penalties in cases in which victims of crimes are chosen ""hatred or animus toward [his or her] actual or perceived disability, religion, color, race, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, or gender."" 
   S. 1105 was adopted as an amendment to the fiscal year 2008 defense authorization bill now under consideration by the Senate. Congress is expected to pass that measure in coming days.

WHITEHOUSE PROTESTS FIRINGS OF FEDERAL PROSECUTORS
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a former U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island, spoke out on the Senate floor this afternoon to protest the Bush administration's unprecedented firings of several U.S. Attorneys. Whitehouse was appointed U.S. Attorney by President Bill Clinton and served in that office from 1994-1998.  
   ""These men and women had been confirmed by the Senate, and the majority had been recognized by the Justice Department as well-qualified and performing admirably in their jobs. Several of them were involved in ongoing public corruption investigations. Yet, in an unprecedented step, this Administration showed them the door,"" Whitehouse said. ""The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that these firings were politically motivated. We need to get to the bottom of this."" 
   Earlier today, former New Mexico U.S. Attorney David Iglesias said he was contacted by two members of Congress in mid-October who, he felt, pressured him for a pre-election indictment in an ongoing probe of a kickback scheme involving local Democrats. Iglesias told McClatchy Newspapers: ""I believe that because I didn't play ball, so to speak, I was asked to resign."" 
   The Bush Administration has argued the prosecutors were ousted because they did not follow priorities set from the Department of Justice. Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which Whitehouse sits, that the firings were ""performance-related"" and attributable to ordinary staff turnover. However, the New York Times reported Sunday that in professional performance reviews, six of the eight prosecutors who were fired were rated as ""'well regarded', 'capable' or 'very competent.'"" 
   Senators Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) are leading a Senate inquiry into the spate of firings, in which Whitehouse is an active participant.

WHITEHOUSE ON STATE OF THE UNION: IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE
  Responding to President Bush's final State of the Union address tonight, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) stressed the urgent need for change. He said: 
   ""Throughout seven long years of this administration, it never seemed as though President Bush was really listening to the American people. Unfortunately, his final State of the Union address tonight was no different.
   ""The President isn't listening to the millions of Americans who want to bring our troops home from Iraq. He isn't listening to people like Mike Tracy, my guest at tonight's speech, whose stories show how desperately we need major reforms in our health care system. He isn't listening to the young people I saw today, who understand that global warming is a serious and urgent threat and stand ready to take immediate action to address it. He isn't listening to the seniors I've met at community dinners across Rhode Island, who worry they will be unable to afford the prescription drugs they depend on.
   ""He isn't listening to the many retired military officers and career intelligence veterans who've told me, in no uncertain terms, that torture degrades our standing in the world and is not an effective way to fight terror. He isn't listening to those of us who believe we can keep Americans safe, but that we must also have strong protections to prevent this administration from systematically violating Americans' civil rights. And he isn't listening to the concerns and fears of working families all over this country, who are watching jobs move overseas and prices at home climb higher.
   ""The state of our union is not as strong as it could or should be, and it appears from tonight's speech that it will take new leadership, with new commitment to change; a new administration to turn it around.
   ""There is much we need to do together to repair our country, and I and my Democratic colleagues in Congress stand ready to work hard every day to bring the change America needs. President Bush should us - not waste more precious time playing politics in the final year of his failed administration.""
   Whitehouse was joined by Riverside resident Mike Tracy as his guest at tonight's speech. Tracy, a cancer survivor, struggled with a misdiagnosis and problems with the transfer of his paper medical records from one hospital to another. His story demonstrates the need for improved health care quality and information technology, issues Whitehouse has made the focus of his work on health care in the Senate.

WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S REFUSAL TO PROVIDE INFORMATION SUBPOENAED BY CONGRESS ON FIRINGS OF U.S. ATTORNEYS
  In response to the Bush administration's statement that it would not provide information subpoenaed by Congress in connection with the ongoing investigation into the firing late last year of several U.S. attorneys, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) delivered the following remarks at a business meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier today:
  ""Mr. Chairman, like the rest of my colleagues I have not had a chance to review the letter from the White House, or the letter from the Solicitor General, at leisure because we've only recently received it. But there are a few phrases from it that leap off the page that I would like to highlight at this point.  
  ""The first is the assertion on the first page that the White House will not be making any production. If there is an executive privilege to be asserted here, presumably it would apply to some documents and not others, and I think it would have been more helpful and more thoughtful if the White House had said, 'here are certain documents we believe fall outside the executive privilege; we've done a thoughtful review of which ones fall in and which ones fall out, and here's our effort to comply with the subpoena.' Instead it's: drawbridge up; archers to the gates; we're closing down; you get nada, nothing. 
  ""The other assertion they make is: there's no demonstration that the documents and information you seek by subpoena are critically important to any legislative initiatives you may be pursuing or intended to pursue. I don't want to repeat what Senator [Ben] Cardin [of Maryland] has just said, but I will associate myself with his remarks about the importance of what we are doing here. And as a former U.S. Attorney, I cannot overstate how important it is to the Department of Justice and to this country that that kind of political interference not reside in the Department of Justice. Ever. And it is a high duty of ours to pursue these very serious allegations that that has taken place. 
  ""And finally, the suggestion at the end of Mr. [Fred] Fielding's letter that 'we may all return to more productive activity on behalf of the nation.' I think it is extremely productive to assure the people of the United States that their Department of Justice can be trusted. It is an enormous power, the power of federal prosecution, and if it is not wielded sensibly, and if it is not wielded honorably, and if it is not wielded without political purpose, we have a grave issue that demands our attention.
  ""And then in the Solicitor General's letter, here's some interesting stuff. He's reviewed the communications among the White House Counsel. Quote: 'these communications discuss specific U.S. Attorneys who could be removed, potential replacement candidates, and possible responses to congressional and media inquires about the dismissals.'
  ""We've been wondering if this went into the White House. Clearly it does. But how and why still need to be determined. 
  ""Finally, they assert privilege over communications between White House officials and individuals outside the executive branch, including with individuals in the legislative branch - and I assume they don't mean the Vice President; they mean others - solely on the basis that there was an understanding that they would be held in confidence. It is not my understanding that executive privilege is driven subjectively by understandings of people involved. It relates to an actual executive privilege, and when it's outside the executive, the argument gets very thin. 
  ""They go so far, and this is the last observation I have, Mr. Chairman, they go so far as to, and I quote, 'assert executive privilege over White House documents, reflecting White House department communications that have been previously disclosed to the committees by the department.' 'That have been previously disclosed by the department.' And they're asserting privilege on that. 
  ""From those elements, and we will obviously review it more closely, it seems to me there has not been a thoughtful or well-intentioned effort to accommodate the committee's subpoena, but rather, as the chairman has so clearly said, a stonewall."".

WHITEHOUSE CALLS FOR COMMITMENT TO REBUILDING
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) issued the following statement today, on the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina:
   ""When I traveled to New Orleans earlier this year, and flew over the Lower 9th Ward, I witnessed block after block of demolished and vacant houses, as far as the eye could see. Two years after Hurricane Katrina struck, the Bush administration still has not kept its promise to rebuild this great American city - and that's disgraceful.
   ""We must rebuild Louisiana's homes and levees - but that alone is not enough. We also have to address the Gulf Coast's disappearing marshes and wetlands, the natural buffer that helps absorb storm surges, but is disappearing rapidly, leaving New Orleans more and more exposed. 
   ""Finally, we have to get the message about climate change, and how shrinking glaciers in Greenland connect to worsening storms on our shores. 
   ""Rhode Islanders will not forget New Orleans - because we in the Ocean State know that the unthinkable can happen here, too. Imagine how angry we would be if two full years after a terrible hurricane Rhode Island still showed scenes of devastation. We must make a serious and sustained commitment to stronger infrastructure, and to government that takes competence seriously - to make certain that a tragedy like the shameful Katrina response never, ever happens again.""
   Whitehouse traveled to New Orleans in February with Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and a delegation of members of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee for a field hearing to study comprehensive approaches to coastal wetlands restoration, hurricane and storm damage protection, and debris waste management following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Senator Mary Landrieu (D-La.), who chairs the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery, joined the committee for its review.
   Whitehouse also took part in a Blackhawk helicopter flyover of neighborhoods damaged by the storm and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects to upgrade flood and storm protection systems. The aerial tour began at Jackson Barracks and traveled over St. Bernard Parish, the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet (MRGO), the Lower 9th Ward, and the outfall canals at Orleans Avenue, 17th Street, and London Avenue.

WHITEHOUSE VOTES FOR FIRST MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE IN A DECADE
  In the new Democratic-led Senate, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) voted with an overwhelming majority of Senators yesterday to pass the first minimum wage increase in ten years. The bill raises the federal minimum wage by $2.10 an hour over two years, to $7.25.

""Democrats listened - and we kept our promise. Raising the minimum wage helps make sure more people in this country are earning the income they need to provide for their families and lift themselves out of poverty."" 
   Increasing the federal minimum wage will be an enormous step forward in the battle against poverty in America. Due to inflation, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) reports, the total income of a family of four supported by one minimum-wage earner sagged about $1,550 below the poverty line in 2006, even when food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) were taken into account. Raising the minimum wage to $7.25, as the Senate did today, could boost that family's income to about $2,615 over the poverty line in 2009. 
   Working families also face high housing, child care, and health care costs that an increase in the minimum wage could help mitigate, according to the CBPP.

  ""The National Intelligence Estimate released today makes clear what most Americans already understand: the situation in Iraq is bad and getting worse, and the President's escalation plan offers no lasting solution for the underlying political and sectarian forces driving the intensifying conflict. 
   ""The persistent failure of Iraqi factions to reconcile and work together, according to this assessment by the intelligence community, is among the key elements fomenting violence and hindering stability in Iraq. Sending tens of thousands more American soldiers there won't change that. Iraqi leaders must decide to unite and take real responsibility for the security and governance of their own country for the efforts of any security force - Iraqi or American - to have a chance at success. 
   ""It remains my firm belief that a clear announcement by the United States that we intend to redeploy our troops from Iraq in a rapid and responsible way is the only path that will both galvanize internal Iraqi reconciliation, encourage broader involvement by Iraq's Arab neighbors to avert the development of a pan-Arabic Sunni/Shiite conflict in the region, and motivate meaningful participation from the international community. 
   ""I'm troubled that the President's policy in Iraq does not seem to be informed by the assessment of our nation's intelligence community. America simply cannot afford the risk that the war in Iraq now threatens of further deterioration of our national security, international standing, military readiness, and well-being of our troops and their families.

They met with Senator Whitehouse in the rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building, and were well prepared with questions about stem cell research, Iraq, alternative energy, and Whitehouse's new life as a Senator. 
   ""I hope you follow up on the interest that brought you here to Washington,"" Whitehouse told them. ""There are so many ways you can make a difference."" 
   This is the seventh year Portsmouth High School has participated in the Close Up Foundation's civics program. Cassady said the school was very supportive of the program, sending as many as 20 students in any given year. 
   The Close Up Foundation was started in 1971 with the mission to ""inform, inspire, and empower people to exercise the rights and accept the responsibilities of citizens in a democracy."" Annually 20,000 students, teachers, and other adults take part in their Washington, DC programs. Since its inception, over 600,000 people have participated in the program. This spring, the week-long Washington Program will run 18 times.

  Senate Democrats joined local officials at a press conference today to discuss the importance of funding local law enforcement and policing initiatives. The Senate will begin debating the Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill this week, and will seek to support important programs to fight crime in our schools and communities after years of cuts by the Bush Administration. 
  ""With violent crime on the rise for the first time in 15 years, President Bush cut state and local law enforcement funding by almost $1.5 billion. The time to act is now,"" said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Chairwoman of the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee. ""This bill provides $2.7 billion to give cops on the beat the tools they need to protect our communities from crime, gangs, drugs, domestic violence and crimes against children. The Democratic Congress will continue to stand up for families and neighborhoods by standing up against the President's veto.""
  Said Senator Robert Menendez: ""The safety of our country begins with how safe we make our own communities. It starts in our neighborhoods, it starts in our schools, and it starts in our homes. By neglecting successful law enforcement programs, the Bush administration's policies have made our communities less safe. The bill before the Senate this weeks reflects an understanding that we have to stop crime before it starts, and that our young people deserve our support. We can stop violence here in America - but we can't do it without a strong commitment like this.""
  ""From the cop on the beat to elite counter-terror units, fighting crime and protecting homes and families takes time, commitment - and most of all, resources,"" said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island Attorney General. ""As Rhode Island's Attorney General, I've seen firsthand that support from the federal government can make the difference between getting the manpower and equipment local law enforcement needs, and having to go without. I'm proud that Senate Democrats are working to strengthen initiatives that reduce crime and keep our communities safe.""
  Said Scott Pfeifer, Principal of Centennial High School in Ellicott City, Md.: ""One of the primary goals of principals is to create a personalized learning environment in which all students and staff feel free to pursue their interests and continued education and development. However, personalization cannot occur if students and staff are distracted by school crime and violence. The COPS in Schools program has provided principals with the resources they need to create and sustain a safe school environment, allowing a culture of learning and excellence to emerge. The COPS program has received a substantial increase in funding, and I urge you to adopt this increased amount.""

  An initiative that connects at-risk children in Warwick and Woonsocket with adult mentors who can make a positive difference in their lives is getting an infusion of federal funds, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) announced today.  
  The Rhode Island Mentoring Partnership will receive $185,537 from the U.S. Department of Education for mentoring programs for Warwick and Woonsocket students in grades 4-8. 
  ""When I was Attorney General, I saw first-hand the enormous change that supportive, involved adults could make in students' lives through the after-school and mentoring programs we built at Oliver Hazard Perry Middle School in Providence,"" Whitehouse said.

He also co-signed a letter with several other Senators to express strong support for providing $100 million in federal funding for mentoring programs in fiscal year 2008.
  The Rhode Island Mentoring Partnership recruits, trains, and supports adults to serve as positive role models for disadvantaged, at-risk children - young people with emotional difficulties, low self-esteem, poor peer relationships, or low academic performance - across the state. Volunteer mentors commit to serving at least one hour per week for one year, and receive regular training from partnership staff.

WHITEHOUSE HIGHLIGHTS GLOBAL WARMING'S THREAT TO OCEAN STATE
  At the first hearing of the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works (EPW), Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) offered a uniquely Rhode Island look at the potentially catastrophic effects of global warming. In a presentation drawing on the expertise and insights of Rhode Island's environmental community, Whitehouse demonstrated evidence that climate change is already at work in Rhode Island - from the cherry trees on his own street to devastating temperature increases in Narragansett Bay.  
   ""Left unchecked, climate change will affect every community in every nation on earth, altering the world in ways we are only beginning to understand. For our Ocean State, warmer temperatures and rising sea levels could mean disaster, our financial centers, tourist destinations, and historic landmarks swept away and lost,"" said Whitehouse. ""This issue is real, time is of the essence, and action is called for."" 
   The earlier and earlier arrival of the spring bloom in Rhode Island is now a documented phenomenon, indicating a trend of warmer temperatures throughout the region, and Narragansett Bay, the state's most distinctive ecological feature, is undergoing a significant ecosystem shift as the water's temperature gradually warms. Whitehouse noted that the Bay's annual mean winter temperature has increased by about 4 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 20 years and that warmer temperatures in the summer can also have profound effects, such as the massive fish kill in Greenwich Bay in the summer of 2003. 
   If Greenland's ice cap melts and causes sea levels to rise by as much as 20 feet worldwide, the nightmare scenario of Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" Whitehouse said, downtown Providence would be inundated, Newport's historic waterfront overwhelmed by its harbor, and coastal residential communities like Barrington completely submerged. 
   ""This cycle is predicted to get worse - much worse - if nothing is done,"" said Whitehouse, who earlier this year joined U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) as a co-sponsor of the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, legislation calling for an 80% reduction in global warming pollutants by 2050. 
   Whitehouse recognized members of Rhode Island's environmental community for their assistance in assembling the data used in his presentation, including Save the Bay, Environment Rhode Island, the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography, Brown University, the Rhode Island Coastal Institute, Rhode Island Clean Water Action, the Rhode Island Chapter of the Sierra Club, and the Rhode Island Conservation Law Foundation.

WHITEHOUSE SUPPORTS REED BILL TO CLOSE 'GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE'
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) yesterday cosponsored legislation that would prohibit the sale of firearms at gun shows without proper background checks for purchasers. The bill, introduced by Senators Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.), would close a gaping loophole in federal law that enables convicted felons and others now ineligible to purchase guns to acquire them at gun shows. 
  ""As a former prosecutor, I'm confident that background checks prevent crime. But when criminals can evade background checks by purchasing a gun at a gun show, all of us are less safe,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""I'm proud to stand with Senator Jack Reed in support of this important crime-fighting legislation."" 
  Under current law, the Brady Act, Americans seeking to purchase firearms are required to obtain Federal Firearms Licenses (FFLs), and background checks are conducted through the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The process to purchase handguns varies state by state. According to the non-profit Brady Campaign, in Rhode Island hand gun purchasers do not need permits, but must pass an FFL check and wait seven days before the transaction can be completed. Waiting periods in other states currently last as long as thirty days. 
  However, the Brady Act does not currently apply to sellers at gun shows who are not ""engaged in the business of selling firearms,"" exempting ""a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases or firearms for the enhancement of a person collection or for a hobby...."" These non-licensees make up one quarter or more of firearms sellers at gun shows. 
  The Lautenberg-Reed bill requires background checks on all firearms purchases at gun shows, defined as an event at which 50 or more guns are available for sale.
  Whitehouse, who served as Rhode Island Attorney General and United States Attorney prior to his election to the Senate, has fought for tough gun control legislation throughout his career in public service. His efforts strengthened penalties for armed criminals and prosecuted members of the Rhode Island Latin Kings, a violent criminal gang that committed murder, and engaged in drug dealing, assault, and racketeering.

WHITEHOUSE APPLAUDS FOCUS ON SENIORS IN PROPOSED STIMULUS MEASURE
  In a speech on the Senate floor, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) applauded the inclusion of aid targeted to seniors in an economic stimulus package now being considered by the Senate. 
   Many seniors who rely on savings and Social Security benefits would not be eligible for assistance under a plan negotiated by President Bush and the House of Representatives. Concerned that thousands of Rhode Island seniors could be excluded from this proposal, Whitehouse wrote Senate leaders in January urging them to prioritize aid to older Americans.  
   Below are Whitehouse's remarks as prepared for delivery.
   I rise today to speak about the economic stimulus package now under consideration by the Senate, and specifically to address the crucial issue of how this package affects our senior citizens.
   Not long ago, at one of my community dinners, a young man named Travis told me a story about his grandmother. She was in her nineties and taking several prescription medications, but was otherwise well enough to live on her own. 
   She had a walk-up apartment in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and every day she went up and down her stairs as she went in and out to take care of errands, or to see her grandson. 
   But one day, she walked down those stairs and went to her pharmacy to pick up her prescriptions as usual - only to find that this was not a usual day. I'm sorry, she was told. You've fallen into the doughnut hole in the Medicare Part D program. 
   So she went back home and walked back up those stairs, and called Travis. Without any help from her Part D insurance, she couldn't afford to pay both for her rent and for the medicines she needed. She was frightened, she told her grandson, that after years of living on her own, she might have to stop making payments on her apartment in order to afford her prescriptions. She might have to give up her independence.
   No one in this country - no one - should have to choose between her health and her home. But too many older Americans are making hard decisions like these every day - stretching fixed incomes to cover mortgage payments, heating bills, costly medications, even food. 
   As I've traveled all over Rhode Island, I've heard many stories like Travis's. America's seniors need to know that we are listening to them, that we have heard them, and that we will do all we can to help them make ends meet.
   As our nation confronts uncertain economic times, this Congress is working diligently to provide help to those who need it most. When the initial agreement between the Administration and the House of Representatives on an economic stimulus proposal was announced, however, I was concerned that many seniors - one of the groups that most needs our aid - would be excluded. 
   Most seniors, who rely on Social Security benefits and savings and thus do not pay income taxes, would not be eligible for a tax rebate based on taxable income and delivered through the IRS. Indeed, 61 percent of seniors who receive Social Security benefits did not pay income taxes in 2006, the last year for which we have data. 
   Today, more than 138,000 Rhode Islanders over the age of 65 receive Social Security benefits, with benefits averaging just $12,374 per year. Based on the national percentage of recipients who pay income tax, more than 84,000 Rhode Island seniors would receive nothing under the plan negotiated by President Bush and the House of Representatives. Nationwide, that number climbs to 21.1 million - thus, more than 20 million seniors would not receive a dime in tax rebates under the House bill. 
   That's not fair. Extending a rebate plan to seniors will give much-needed breathing room to millions of older Americans struggling to get by. 
   It also makes good economic sense. According to the Department of Labor, Americans over 65 are responsible for 14 percent of all consumer spending - and they spend an average of 92 percent of their income each year. In 2006 alone, seniors purchased more than $800 billion in consumer goods. 
   That data suggests that any rebate we're able to provide for seniors will provide just the kind of economic stimulus our country needs. Older Americans are more likely to spend the money they receive and to spend it on the goods and services that will help our economy grow. In a Budget Committee hearing, I asked Peter Orszag, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which would be a faster stimulus to the economy: Social Security or tax rebates. He testified: ""Social Security.""
   Last week, I wrote the Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate urging them to make seniors a priority in any stimulus package we consider. 
   I am encouraged that the Senate Finance Committee, chaired by my distinguished colleague from Montana, Max Baucus, has reported a bill that would allow most seniors to receive a $500 rebate. Under the Finance Committee proposal, Social Security benefits would be considered as income for this limited purpose, and seniors with at least $3,000 in Social Security benefits for 2007 could claim the $500 per person rebate simply by filing a tax return. 
   Because many seniors do not have enough taxable income to require them to file a tax return, they haven't filed in years and are not used to the process. Should this proposal become law, we must do all we can to inform seniors about the rebates to which they are entitled, and to help them claim these much-needed rebates. For example, accountants, social services workers, and lawyers could volunteer their services to help seniors fill out and file tax returns. 
   Many seniors could desperately use an extra $500 - to help pay for prescription drugs, rising fuel costs, and housing - and we must ensure that no senior misses out on this money because of misinformation or difficulty in navigating tax forms. 
   This solution is a strong step forward. I applaud the work of Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Chuck Grassley of the Finance Committee, and look forward to continuing our efforts to pass an economic stimulus proposal that meets the pressing needs of America's seniors while accelerating the stimulus the economy needs.

WHITEHOUSE: PRESIDENT BUSH MUST NOT VETO HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) spoke on the Senate floor in support of legislation to protect health care coverage for 6.6 million low-income children and provide insurance to 3.2 million more - a measure President Bush has threatened to veto. The bill would renew and improve the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which supports programs like RIteCare. Senator Whitehouse's remarks are as delivered.
   MR. WHITEHOUSE: Mr. President, I speak today in support of the Children's Health Insurance Program. I want to first applaud the Finance Committee for its bipartisan 17-to-4 vote to approve this bill. I thank Senators Baucus, Rockefeller, Grassley, and Hatch, Majority Leader Reid, and also the staff of the Finance Committee for all their hard work through the very difficult negotiations that made it possible to bring this critical measure so strongly to the floor. 
   I also recognize Rhode Island's role in this piece of legislation, going all the way back to the distinguished Senator John Chafee, one of the early bipartisan sponsors of the bill. Now on the floor today, my senior Senator, Jack Reed, has been one of the most powerful and outstanding advocates for this program in this institution. I am proud to join him in supporting this bill and in this fight.
   I am proud also to represent a State with one of the lowest rates of uninsured adults and children in the Nation. There is a reason. Rhode Island has worked over the past 15 years to achieve this success, beginning with the RIteCare program in 1993. In 2001, the creation of this Children's Health Insurance Program allowed Rhode Island to further reduce the number of uninsured children in the State. I am proud to have been part of Gov. Bruce Sundlun's team when he started the original RIteCare program in 1993.
   As health care costs skyrocket, and the number of people in this country who lack health insurance approaches the staggering number of 50 million, we in Congress have an obligation to strengthen initiatives like RIteCare that make health care more accessible.
   For years, the Children's Health Insurance Program has given millions of uninsured American families access to health care for their kids. And pretty much everyone has thought this was a good thing. But now, setting aside reason, and driven by ideology, President Bush has threatened to lift his veto pen for only the fourth time in his Presidency to take that security and peace of mind away from these children and from their worried moms and dads, from families similar to the ones the Senator from Ohio highlighted in his eloquent remarks a moment ago.
   The President claims the $35 billion improvement over 5 years is too expensive. The President would prefer only the $5 billion he included in his budget. But that funding level would result in 1 million American children losing their health insurance. We certainly cannot look to President Bush for leadership.
   How ironic, after all we have heard from this administration praising the State Children's Health Insurance Program and even taking credit for expanding coverage, for encouraging State flexibility, and for spurring innovation at the State level.
   Listen to what they used to say. In the administration's plan outlining the President's second term, their fact sheet boasted:
   The year before President Bush took office, some 3.3 million low-income children were enrolled in SCHIP. By 2003, that number had risen to 5.8 million, a 75 percent increase. Over that same period, by working cooperatively with State Governors, the Department of Health and Human Services increased the number of low-income adults on Medicaid by 6.8 million.
   That was then, this is now.
   After that, the administration went on to lament the fact that ""millions of children who are eligible for SCHIP or Medicaid coverage are not yet enrolled. Billions in Federal dollars available to the States to insure these children remain unspent because these children haven't been signed up.""
   Then, at the 2004 Republican National Convention, President Bush promised this:
   In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the Government's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention or information to stand between these children and the health care they need.
   But now the same Bush administration, the same President, is aggressively planning to deny health insurance to poor children. How does this make any sense?
   The President's rationale for this new parsimony was revealed before an audience in Cleveland on July 10. Here is the President's approach to health insurance for America. You just pointed this out, Mr. President:
   I mean, people have access to health care in America; after all, you just go to an emergency room.
   Well, that is a thoughtful approach. Once again, we cannot look to our President for any leadership on this issue.
   The administration has also expressed its opposition to the cigarette tax that will fund the increases in children's health insurance, calling it-get this-among the most regressive revenue-raising measures one could propose. That is from a letter from Secretary Leavitt to Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley.
   The irony department is open late in the Bush administration. In evaluating their crocodile tears about regressive tax measures, consider that this Nation will spend $233 billion in 2008 on the Bush tax cuts, 30 percent of which will go to the top 1 percent of income earners. From 2008 through 2011, the period we are talking about for children's health care, those tax cuts will cost Americans, in lost revenue and interest on the debt, nearly $1 trillion, 22 percent of which will go to people who earn more than $1 million a year.
   This chart illustrates just how the cost of tax cuts for the top 1 percent of Americans compares to the cost of expanding health care for children in this country. We are spending vastly more each year on tax cuts for the Nation's highest income earners than we are fighting for in children's health care.
   Here it is, $2.1 billion for children's health care in 2008, $70 billion for the richest 1 percent; $5 billion in fiscal year 2009 for children's health care, $72 billion for the richest 1 percent; and in 2010, gosh, we go all the way to $7.9 billion for children's health care with only $82 billion for the richest 1 percent.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that in just this year alone-just this year alone-we are paying an extra $46 billion in interest, not paying back the debt, just in interest, on the Bush tax cuts-$46 billion just in 1 year. And the whole thing we are arguing about here is $35 billion over 5 years for children's health care. It is truly mind-boggling.
   But it doesn't end there. The President has also threatened to veto the bill based on its coverage of adults. This is a policy that the administration has previously, explicitly, repeatedly approved. This is a sudden ideological U-turn of stunning and deeply hypocritical proportions.
   As recently as last summer at a Finance Committee hearing on children's health insurance, then CMS Administrator Mark McClellan said the following:
   Extending coverage to parents and caretaker relatives not only serves to cover additional insured individuals, but it may also increase the likelihood that they will take the steps necessary to enroll their children. Extending coverage to parents and caretakers may also increase the likelihood that their children remain enrolled in SCHIP.
   That was then, this is now.
   This administration has approved waivers to cover parents in New Mexico, Illinois, Oregon, New Jersey, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Fewer than 2 months ago, on May 30 of this year, Leslie Norwalk, who was then Acting Administrator of CMS, was ``pleased to inform'' Wisconsin that its extension request for what they call BadgerCare-it is equivalent to RIteCare in Rhode Island-had been approved through March 31, 2010. BadgerCare covers roughly 67,000 parents. Again, this waiver was approved by the Bush administration 8 weeks ago, and now he is threatening a veto for care that covers adults.
   Here is a copy of the letter that CMS Administrator Mark McClellan sent to my home State of Rhode Island on January 13, 2006. It reads:
   We are pleased to inform you that your amendment to the RIteCare section 1115 demonstration, as modified by the Special Terms and Conditions accompanying this award letter, has been approved.
   It also notes:
   Rhode Island's request to renew title XXI, section 1115, demonstration project, dated July 15, 2005, with additional information ..... has also been approved.
   Finally, it notes:
   Individuals who, at the time of initial application, are custodial parents or relative caretakers of children who are eligible under the title XIX State plan or the title XXI State plan .....
   Are in the demonstration population and, of course, ``we look forward to continuing to work with you and your staff.'' Signed Mark B. McClellan, M.D., Ph.D., the Administrator of CMS. This was January of 2006. This is the Bush administration. This is them signing off on adults, custodial parents, or relative caretakers of children being in the plan.
   Yet now the President is shocked-shocked-that this program may cover some adults. Who didn't send him the memo?
   At the end of May, I spoke on the Senate floor about some of the major problems facing health care in this country. I talked about the lack of investment in quality improvements, the lack of a national information technology infrastructure, and a reimbursement system that pays doctors to perform procedures rather than to help patients get well. I took these issues to the Senate floor because the structure of our system is unsound, its underlying mechanism is broken, its signals are misaligned.
   But there are a few shining lights in the American health care system, and the Children's Health Insurance Program is among the brightest. This program respects State flexibility, it encourages responsiveness to local needs, it fertilizes structural creativity in the health care arena, it safeguards the vulnerable, it unites families, and it invests in the future of our Nation.
   The Children's Health Insurance Program means that children are more likely to receive medical care for common conditions such as asthma or ear infections. It means that children have higher school attendance rates. It means that children have higher academic achievement. It means that children have more contact with medical professionals and receive more preventive care. It means that children stay out of expensive urgent care settings, such as the emergency room.
   We choose now in this bill and in this debate between providing our Nation's children with health insurance and not providing our Nation's children with health insurance. It is as simple as that. We choose now whether every individual in this Nation, regardless of age, gender, race, income, or health status deserves the stability and the safety that health insurance provides. We choose for millions of American families how much they have to worry, how much moms and dads have to worry about the health care of their children.
   It is my duty as a representative of the people of Rhode Island, and it is our collective duty as representatives of a great Nation to stick up for the most vulnerable members of our society and for programs that protect those who cannot protect themselves. We must certainly not give up in the face of an administration that willingly violates its own principles in order to create an issue on which the President can deliver a veto as a desperate political stunt in the last bleak chapters of his collapsed Presidency-not at the cost of health care for children. That would be truly pathetic.
   I yield the floor.

  The Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee has approved legislation pushing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow states to set strict limits on pollution from cars, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) announced. Whitehouse, a committee member, is a cosponsor of the bill, designated S. 1785. 
  ""Rhode Islanders are committed to taking common-sense, concrete steps to cut greenhouse gas emissions - but years of stonewalling and delay by the Bush administration have allowed millions of tons of global warming pollution into our air and made it more difficult to reverse the long-term effects of climate change,"" Whitehouse said. ""We can already see the effects of global warming in the Ocean State. This bill makes it clear that the President must let Rhode Island move forward to protect our people and our environment.""
  Rhode Island is one of twelve states seeking approval of a waiver, requested from EPA by the state of California, that would allow states to mandate a stricter vehicle emissions standard than required under federal law. If approved, the new standard would force automakers to manufacture vehicles that emit lower levels of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, that contribute to global warming. According to a report released earlier this year by Environment Rhode Island, the twelve states' programs will reduce gasoline consumption, generate savings for consumers, and cut emissions by 74 million metric tons per year in 2020. Cumulative reductions in global warming pollutants between 2009 and 2020, the report said, would reach as high as 392 million metric tons - a drop equal to taking 74 million of today's cars off the road for a year.
  The EPA has refused to take steps to approve the waiver, based on a years-long argument that it does not have the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles. While the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year that EPA does, in fact, have that authority, EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson has claimed his agency still needs more time to review the waiver requests.
  Whitehouse, a vocal advocate for action to combat climate change, returned earlier this week from a trip to Greenland, where he and other members of the EPW Committee toured glaciers and ice fields endangered by global warming. He is a cosponsor of the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, legislation sponsored by Boxer and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to call for an 80% reduction - compared to 1990 levels - in global warming pollutants by 2050.

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) issued the following statement in response to the resignation today of Alphonso Jackson, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): 
   ""Secretary Jackson's resignation amidst allegations of corruption shows once again the culture of the Bush Administration putting cronyism and partisanship before responsible governance. From 'Heckuva Job, Brownie' to former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to Jackson, we've seen far too many Bush officials whose defining characteristic was loyalty to the President and his political supporters, rather than competence in their jobs.
   ""As millions of hard-working Americans struggle with the worsening economy, they deserve a government that looks out for them, not the special interests. President Bush has already done too little to assist families who face foreclosure of their homes. I urge the President to quickly nominate a successor who will focus his or her full attention on helping American homeowners - not enriching cronies and political allies at taxpayer expense.""

WHITEHOUSE ANNOUNCES HE WILL OPPOSE JUDGE MUKASEY NOMINATION
  Calling questions over the Bush Administration's views on torture a seminal moment for the nation, U.S. Senator and former U.S. Attorney Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) announced in a speech on the Senate floor today that he will oppose Judge Michael Mukasey's nomination to be the next U.S. Attorney General. 
   During a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 18, Whitehouse asked Judge Mukasey whether he believed the practice of waterboarding is constitutional. In a response widely seen as unsatisfactory, Judge Mukasey replied: ""If it amounts to torture, it is not constitutional.""
  Whitehouse's remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below. 
  The Senate is now called upon to consider President Bush's nominee to succeed Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General of this nation, the person we must rely on to repair what has been left broken, to uphold the rule of law where political loyalties once ruled, and to lead the Department of Justice forward at a time of upheaval, and of urgency.
  In many ways, President Bush has made a fine appointment in Judge Michael Mukasey, far better than we have come to expect in this administration.
  He is not a political hack. He is not a partisan ideologue. He is not an incompetent crony. We've had our share of those. 
  No, he is a brilliant lawyer, a distinguished jurist, and by all accounts a good man.
  And no one feels more keenly than do I the need for repair and recovery of the Department of Justice. In a small way, I served this Department, as a US Attorney, and I feel how important this great institution is to our country, and how important an Attorney General, such as Judge Mukasey could be, is to this great institution. 
  I wish it were so easy. But there are times in history that rear up, and become a swivel point on which our direction as a nation can turn. 
  The discussion of torture in recent days has made this such a point. Suddenly, even unexpectedly, this time has come.
  It calls us to think - What is it that makes this country great? Whence cometh our strength? 
  First, of course, is a strong economy, to pay for military and foreign aid activities, to attract the best and the brightest from around the world to our land, and to reward hard work and invention, boldness and innovation. 
  Now is not the time to discuss how we have traded away our heartland jobs, how our education system is failing in international competition, how a broken health care system drags us down, how an unfunded trillion dollar war, and the borrowing to pay for it, compromise our strength. For now, let me just recognize that a strong economy is necessary to our strength. 
  But a strong economy is only necessary, not sufficient.
  Ultimately, America is an ideal.
  America for centuries has been called a ""shining city on a hill."" We are a lamp to other nations. A great Senator said ""America is not a land, it's a promise.""
  Torture breaks that promise; extinguishes that lamp; darkens that city. 
  When Judge Mukasey came before the Judiciary Committee, he was asked about torture, and about one particular practice, which has its roots in the Spanish Inquisition. Waterboarding involves strapping somebody in a reclining position, heels above head, putting a cloth over their face and pouring water over the cloth to create the feeling of drowning. As Senator John McCain, who spent years in a prison camp in North Vietnam, has said, ""It is not a complicated procedure. It is torture.""
  The Judge Advocates General of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines have agreed that the use of simulated drowning would violate U.S. law and the laws of war. Several Judge Advocates General told Congress that waterboarding would specifically constitute torture under the federal Anti-Torture Statute, making it a felony offense.
  Judge Mukasey himself acknowledged that ""these techniques seem over the line or, on a personal basis, repugnant to me."" He noted that waterboarding would be in violation of the Army Field Manual. 
  But in our hearing last week, asked specifically whether the practice of waterboarding is constitutional, he would say no more than: ""if it amounts to torture, it is not constitutional,"" and since then he has failed to recognize that waterboarding is clearly a form of torture, is unconstitutional, and is unconditionally wrong. 
  There are practical faults when American tortures. It breaks the Golden Rule - do unto others as you would have them do unto you, enshrined in the Army Field Manual with the question, if it were done to your men, would you consider it abuse? 
  There are practical concerns over whether torture actually works, whether it is sound, professional interrogation practice. I am not an expert, but experts seem to say it is not. 
  But the more important question is the one I asked earlier - whence cometh our strength as a nation? 
  Our strength comes from the fact that we stand for something. 
  Our strength comes from the aspirations of millions around the globe who want to be like us, who want their country to be like ours.
  Our strength comes when we embody the hopes and dreams of mankind.
  September 11th was a terrible catastrophe that rocked our nation to its core. But when tens of thousands of Americans died in the Argonne Forest, we did not lose our character as a nation. Are we not as strong now as then?
  September 11th was a terrible catastrophe that challenged our economy, our politics, and our way of life. But Japan withstood two nuclear explosions, and it is today an economically and culturally vibrant country. Are we not made of stuff as strong as they?
  September 11th was a terrible catastrophe, and it lives on as a test for our nation. But the real catastrophe would be if we sell our birthright for a mess of pottage, if we sell our destiny as a lamp to other nations and a beacon to a suffering world, for bits of coerced intelligence.
  I don't think anyone intended this nomination to turn on this issue. So many of us saw with relief an end to the ordeal of the Department of Justice, and wished this nomination to succeed. 
  But for whatever reason, this moment has appeared, unbidden, as a moment of decision on who we are and what we are as a nation. What path will we follow? Will we continue America's constant steady path toward the light? 
  Will we trust in our ideals? Will we recognize the strength that comes when men and women rise in villages and hamlets and barrios around the world and say, that is what I want my country to be like; that is the world I choose, and turn their faces toward our light.
  Or, if I may borrow from Churchill, will we head down ""the stairway which leads to a dark gulf. It is a fine broad stairway at the beginning, but after a bit the carpet ends. A little farther on there are only flagstones, and a little farther on still these break beneath your feet""? Will we join that gloomy historical line leading from the Inquisition, through the prisons of tyrant regimes, through gulags and dark cells, and through Saddam Hussein's torture chambers? Will that be the path we choose?
  I hope not.
  I am deeply torn between this man and this moment. This is a good man, I believe. But this moment can help turn us back toward the light, and away from that dark and descending stairway. If this moment can awaken us to the strength of our ideals and principles, then, with whatever strength I have, I feel it is my duty to put my shoulder to this moment, and with whatever strength God has given me, to push toward the light.
  One might argue that this makes Mr. Mukasey an innocent victim in a clash between Congress and the President - that no nominee for Attorney General will be able to satisfy Congress or the American people on the question of torture, because the President, or perhaps the Vice President, will not allow any nominee to draw that bright line at what we all know in our hearts and minds to be abhorrent to our Constitution and our values. 
  Well, Mr. President, that is exactly the point. If we allow the President of the United States to prevent, to forbid, a would-be Attorney General of the United States - the most highly-visible representative of our rule of law - from recognizing that bright line, we will have turned down that dark stairway. I cannot stand for that. I will oppose this nomination.

  Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales asking the Department of Justice to establish appropriate safeguards to avoid potential conflicts of interest as the Judiciary Committee continues its ongoing investigation into the dismissals and replacements of several U.S. attorneys. 
   Leahy, the chairman of the committee, and Whitehouse, a member of the panel and a former U.S. attorney, asked the Attorney General for the protocol the Department of Justice is following as the Committee determines how to proceed with respect to Monica Goodling, a Department official who has asserted her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination rather than cooperate with the committee's inquiry.  
   ""The office of the Attorney General appears to be hopelessly conflicted,"" wrote Leahy and Whitehouse. 
   The Senators also sought information about Goodling's cooperation with a pair of internal DOJ investigations that have been launched into the matter. The Committee was informed last week that Goodling is on leave, but remains a paid employee with the Department after asserting her Fifth Amendment rights. The Department's policies require employees to cooperate with internal investigations. 
   The text of the letter is below. A pdf is available upon request.

   The Honorable Alberto Gonzales 
   Attorney General of the United States 
   U.S. Department of Justice 
   950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW 
   Washington, DC 20530 
   Dear Attorney General Gonzales: 
   As you are aware, Monica Goodling has indicated that she will assert her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination before the Senate Judiciary Committee 
   rather than testify. You must know that her testimony would be important to the Judiciary Committee, since you offered her as a Department witness and agreed in your meeting with Judiciary Committee Senators on March 8 that the Department would cooperate with the Committee in providing her testimony along with that of others. 
   In the ordinary course, the Committee would discuss this with your Department to determine the best course of action with respect to a witness who has asserted Fifth 
   Amendment rights against self-incrimination, so as not to unwittingly hinder a prosecution by the Department. While it is premature to presume that any criminal prosecution will result from this inquiry now, it is also premature to presume one will not. It therefore seems advisable to have discussions between the Committee and the 
   Department regarding how to proceed with regard to Ms. Goodling. Our question to you is: Who do we talk to at the Department of Justice? The office of the Attorney General appears to be hopelessly conflicted. 
   We would appreciate hearing from you whether a special counsel is necessary for us to speak with, or how you suggest creating appropriate firewalls so that a non-conflicted person with appropriate knowledge and authority can have the customary discussions with the Committee regarding Ms. Goodling's testimony. 
   On a related matter, we understand that you initially ordered an investigation by the Department's Office of Professional Responsibility and that a joint Office of Inspector 
   General and Office of Professional Responsibility investigation is now under way. Is Ms. Goodling cooperating with that investigation? It is our understanding that career Department employees are required to cooperate with OIG and OPR investigations. 
   We are told by the Department that despite Ms. Goodling's unwillingness to testify, she nonetheless remains on your payroll. Has it ever happened in the history of the 
   Department of Justice that an attorney has refused to cooperate with OIG or OPR or asserted Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and remained an employee of the Department? Please provide information regarding any precedent for these extraordinary circumstances. 
   We would appreciate hearing from you promptly on these matters. 
   Sincerely, 
   PATRICK LEAHY SHELDON WHITEHOUSE

WHITEHOUSE RAISES AWARENESS OF TAX RELIEF FOR WORKING FAMILIES
  With the income tax filing deadline just two weeks away, on Tuesday, April 3, 2007, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) joined the John Hope Settlement House and representatives from the IRS to offer free tax preparation assistance and advice to working families. The event was driven by an effort to raise awareness of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which last year went unclaimed by more than 13,000 eligible Rhode Islanders.  
   ""Working families have earned these tax credits,"" Whitehouse said. ""At a time when the Bush administration seems more focused on cutting taxes for millionaires than providing real tax relief for working families, it's important that low-income taxpayers in our state know that programs like the EITC exist to help them."" 
   The IRS estimates that 76,000-79,000 Rhode Islanders were eligible for the EITC last year, a benefit worth up to $4,536 for a family with two or more children this year. According to the IRS, 64,981 tax filers in Rhode Island claimed the credit in the 2005 tax year, for a total tax benefit of $116 million. Nationally, the IRS estimated that 20% of people who may qualify for the EITC are not aware of the credit. In 2005, 22 million taxpayers received $41 billion in benefits from the EITC, making it one of the largest tax relief programs for American workers. 
   The John Hope Settlement House is part of a Rhode Island coalition that provides volunteer tax preparation assistance at eight venues across the state. The service is funded by both the United Way and the Casey Foundation. The program assisted 1,600 EITC filers last year and hopes to exceed that total this year. This year's filing deadline is April 17. 
   Senator Whitehouse, a strong advocate for working families, recently joined Senator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) to unveil legislation designed to offer real tax relief to middle class families. The tax relief package consisted of four components, designed to help families during times of need: expansion of the child tax credit, relief from the individual Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), simplification and expansion of higher education tax credits, and a new elder-care credit for families caring for aging loved ones.

To ensure confidentiality, the Senators directed the Department to exclude any information that could identify the target or district of the investigation.

   Dear Inspector General Fine: 
   In his testimony at the Judiciary Committee's April 19, 2007, oversight hearing, Attorney General Gonzales assured the Committee that the Department of Justice has been conducting public corruption cases without a partisan bias and urged us to examine the Department's record of these types of investigations. However, due to the necessary confidentiality of these matters, there is no proper basis for us to make the examination that the Attorney General urged. 
   One of the principal questions raised by the Committee's investigation into the mass firings of U.S. Attorneys is whether law enforcement at the Department of Justice has been corrupted by partisan politics. This question needs to be answered. At the same time, public corruption investigations are highly confidential, and need to be kept that way. 
   In order to reconcile these imperatives, we ask your office to prepare a review of the Department's public corruption investigations commenced under the current administration, and prepare an analysis that is stripped of any identifying information as to target or district, but reveals the breakdown of cases by party affiliation of targets at key investigative points, such as opening of case, commencement of grand jury activity, charging, trial, and conviction. 
   This information will be a benefit to the Committee's investigation by helping us assess the Department's record on public corruption cases while protecting confidentiality necessary to these public corruption cases. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

WHITEHOUSE CHAIRS HEARING TO INVESTIGATE BARRIER TO E-PRESCRIBING
  The Senate Judiciary Committee today explored a major barrier to improved health outcomes and cost savings in the health care system - the federal prohibition on electronic prescribing of controlled substances. The hearing was chaired by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a former prosecutor and strong advocate for health information technology. 
  ""Health information technology's potential for better-coordinated care, reduced medical errors, and increased patient satisfaction and peace of mind is enormous,"" Whitehouse said. ""We have to tackle the roadblocks that prevent this extraordinary technology from being available nationwide."" 
  Allowing doctors to write and submit drug prescriptions electronically costs less, saves time, and helps avoid dangerous medical errors and drug interactions. E-prescribing, used today in about 18 percent of doctors' practices, is often cited as a necessary first step towards a national health information technology infrastructure.
  Studies show a fully-operational health IT system could generate an estimated $80 billion in health care savings each year. E-prescribing alone could save $20 billion annually, as patients would experience fewer adverse drug events (ADEs) and would be more likely to adhere to a medication regimen. The Center for Information Technology Leadership (CITL) found that a national e-prescribing system could prevent 2.1 million ADEs - 130,000 of which are life-threatening - and 190,000 hospitalizations per year. 
  But federal rules governing dispensation of controlled substances such as pain medications, antidepressants and some drugs used to treat asthma in children require that doctors write paper prescriptions for these pharmaceuticals. The result is that most doctors resort to writing all their prescriptions by hand rather than maintain a paper system for controlled substances and an electronic system for non-controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the agency responsible for investigation and prosecution of crimes involving the illicit use of controlled substances, has been developing regulations to allow e-prescription for controlled substances for more than four years. They have offered no deadline for completion of these regulations.
  ""Billion-dollar transactions are done electronically; highly classified national security information travels electronically; military attack aircraft are targeted electronically. Don't tell me we can't figure out a way for a doctor to prescribe Vicodin electronically,"" Whitehouse said.
  In October, during consideration of a bill appropriating funds for DEA and the Justice Department, Whitehouse engaged in a Senate floor colloquy with Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), and Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) to discuss electronic prescribing for controlled substances. During that colloquy, Whitehouse proposed a joint report by the DEA and the Department of Health and Human Services assessing the status of rule changes that would permit this practice.
  Today's hearing, Whitehouse said, is an opportunity to hear from federal regulators and health information technology experts on the progress of rule-making in this area and the potential benefits and challenges of an e-prescribing system for controlled substances. Witnesses included Laura Adams of the Rhode Island Quality Institute, an organization Whitehouse founded that is a leader in the state's efforts to improve health care quality and health information technology utilization.
  Whitehouse served as U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island from 1994-98 and as the state's Attorney General from 1999-2003. A longtime supporter of health information technology, he has introduced Senate legislation to establish a private, non-profit corporation tasked with developing a national, interoperable, secure health IT system (S. 1455).

  ""The notion that the definition of impropriety for DOJ employees should be set so low as to more or less mirror the definition of criminal obstruction of justice is disturbing,"" Whitehouse wrote in a letter to Department of Justice Inspector General Glenn Fine. ""Indeed, it implies that it would be perfectly appropriate to dismiss a U.S. Attorney because he or she did not, for example, act in a sufficiently partisan manner, although without regard to a particular case."" 
  Fine and H. Marshall Jarrett, head of the Office of Professional Responsibility, recently announced that their joint investigation into the U.S. Attorneys' removals would be expanded to cover the extent to which improper or partisan considerations influenced hiring practices at the Justice Department. Whitehouse asked Fine to investigate the source of the ""particular case"" standard to determine ""whether it is based on any internal DOJ guideline or policy, whether it is an ad hoc standard devised by DOJ employees to justify their behavior, whether there is any other explanation for its repeated use, and whether it is an appropriate standard."" 
  Whitehouse served as U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island from 1994-1998. He is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

  Glenn A. Fine
   Inspector General
   The Department of Justice 
   950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
   Washington, D.C. 20530-0001
  Dear Inspector General Fine:
  I was pleased to read your May 30, 2007 letter to Senators Leahy and Specter regarding the expansion of the investigation into the removals of United States Attorneys being conducted jointly by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR). Exploring to what extent improper considerations went into the hiring decisions at the Department of Justice (DOJ) is vital to understanding, and correcting, the problems that have come to light over the past few months.  
   There are two additional issues that I believe merit investigation by the OIG. 
  The first relates to a conversation between Michael Elston, the Chief of Staff to the Deputy Attorney General, and H.E. ""Bud"" Cummins, the former United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. According to a document provided to Congress by Mr. Cummins (see attached), Mr. Elston called Mr. Cummins on February 20, 2007 to issue, in Mr. Cummins' words, a ""threat of retaliation"" in response to Mr. Cummins and other dismissed U.S. Attorneys publicly discussing the circumstances surrounding their terminations. 
  However, in an article published by McClatchy Newspapers on March 5, 2007, DOJ's spokesperson, Brian Roehrkasse, denied that the conversation between Mr. Elston and Mr. Cummins ever took place (see attached). Indeed, Mr. Roehrkasse stated, ""It is unfortunate that the press would choose to run an allegation from an anonymous source from a conversation that never took place."" (Emphasis added) Given that the call clearly did take place, we are left with two possible scenarios: either Mr. Roehrkasse intentionally misstated the facts, or someone misled Mr. Roehrkasse in order to mislead the public. Neither scenario is acceptable behavior for any employee at the Department of Justice, let alone high-ranking officials. Therefore, I request that the OIG investigate the circumstances leading to Mr. Roehrkasse's clearly false statement. 
  The second issue relates to the narrow ""particular case"" standard of wrongdoing that high-ranking DOJ officials have adopted during the course of the congressional investigation into the U.S. Attorney removals. That standard was first articulated to the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 29, 2007 by Kyle Sampson, the former Chief of Staff to the Attorney General, when he said: 
  ""The limited category of improper reasons [to dismiss a U.S. Attorney] includes an effort to interfere with or influence the investigation or prosecution of a particular case for political or partisan advantage.""
  On April 19, 2007, at his testimony before the same Committee, Attorney General Gonzales used almost verbatim language in defending his actions:
  ""I know that I did not, and would not, ask for a resignation of any individual in order to interfere with or influence a particular prosecution for partisan political gain.""
  Since then, after the Attorney General testified before the House Judiciary Committee, the Justice Department issued another nearly identical statement: 
  ""It is again clear that the Attorney General did not ask for the resignation of any individual in order to interfere with or influence a particular prosecution for partisan political gain.""
  The notion that the definition of impropriety for DOJ employees should be set so low as to more or less mirror the definition of criminal obstruction of justice is disturbing. Indeed, it implies that it would be perfectly appropriate to dismiss a U.S. Attorney because he or she did not, for example, act in a sufficiently partisan manner, although without regard to a particular case. 
  I request that you investigate the derivation of this ""particular case"" standard. Specifically, the public ought to know whether it is based on any internal DOJ guideline or policy, whether it is an ad hoc standard devised by DOJ employees to justify their behavior, whether there is any other explanation for its repeated use, and whether it is an appropriate standard.
  I look forward to your response. 
  Sincerely, 
  Sheldon Whitehouse
   United States Senator.

WHITEHOUSE SPEAKS OUT ON SENATE FLOOR AGAINST BUSH'S VETO OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I) made the following remarks on the Senate floor this morning to protest President Bush's irresponsible veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides health care coverage to millions of American children. The following is as delivered: 
   Mr. President, as I have traveled around Rhode Island, I have met so many families who worry about health care. Will their child fall ill? Will the price of prescription drugs or a visit to the doctor go up again?
   As health care costs skyrocket and the number of uninsured Americans approaches a staggering 50 million, we have a solemn obligation to make health care more accessible and affordable. 
   This obligation is not new. For decades, our Government has treated it as one of the most sacred promises we keep with the American people, and it has been one of our best opportunities to just plain do the right thing. Initiatives such as Medicare and Medicaid are among our greatest accomplishments. The Children's Health Insurance Program is a shining light in the American health care system, providing health coverage to millions of American children whose families could not otherwise afford insurance.
   Since its creation in 1997, the Children's Health Insurance Program has given children in America's working families better access to medical care for common conditions such as asthma or ear infections, better school attendance rates, better academic achievement, better medical access, and more preventive care. It means that children stay out of expensive urgent care settings such as the emergency room. The Children's Health Insurance Program is among the singular health care success stories of our generation. That is why it has long enjoyed bipartisan support, including enthusiastic support from Republican Governors.
   My State of Rhode Island has played a vital role in creating and sustaining the Children's Health Insurance Program. The distinguished Republican Senator, John Chafee, whom so many of my colleagues will remember, was one of the early bipartisan architects of this bill.
   For years, my senior Senator, Jack Reed, has been one of the most powerful advocates for this program in the Senate. I am proud to add my voice of support to his.
   I am proud also to represent a State with one of the lowest rates of uninsured children and adults in the Nation. Rhode Island has worked for 15 years to achieve this success, beginning with Gov. Bruce Sundlun's establishment of the original RIteCare Program in 1993. I was honored to have been part of Governor Sundlun's team.
   Similar to many State programs, RIteCare relies on this funding that the President vetoed - relies on it to help families pay for regular checkups, immunizations, prescriptions, nutrition and other services and to reduce the number of uninsured children in our State.
   This year, leaders on both sides of the aisle came together in the Senate to make this strong, vital program even stronger. The $35 billion agreement Congress passed last week would have brought health care to 10 million American children over the next 5 years, including adding up to 6,600 currently uninsured children in Rhode Island. We improved the program in other ways as well, adding quality dental and mental health care for children and new incentives for States to enroll more eligible children and to improve the quality of care.
   But President Bush took all that away with the stroke of his veto pen. Why? Health insurance, he says, should be delivered in the private market. Well, guess what, Mr. President. The majority of children's health beneficiaries receive their coverage through private health plans. In fact, in 2005, all but two separate State children's health programs used a managed care company to provide CHIP benefits.
   The children's health plan does not threaten privatized health care; it is privatized health care for almost two-thirds of its enrollees.
   In Rhode Island, the Children's Health Insurance Program is delivered entirely through private insurers. As I have displayed here, the children's health program looks a lot like the health insurance the President has and the Senate has, and it doesn't look anything like the socialized medicine Republican opponents of this program have used as a red herring.
   By the way, as a footnote on the public versus private health insurance question, maybe President Bush - who claims to be a fiscal conservative - would be pleased to learn that the small group of children's health beneficiaries who actually are in public insurance programs, cost the Government less than those who are on private insurance. In fact, publicly insured children cost taxpayers 10 percent less than privately insured children, and publicly insured adults cost 30 percent less than privately insured adults.
   But the President is not persuaded by these facts. It does not matter to him that publicly insured children have a much better chance of having a well child care visit than uninsured children and a much better chance of having a dental care visit. It does not matter that practical Republican Governors across the country support this bill, or that it is one of the most bipartisan achievements of this Congress. All that seems to matter to this President is ideology, and in this case, it is a bizarre ideology that doesn't think struggling, working-class families should have health care. In fact, he especially doesn't believe that struggling, working-class parents should have health care. He threatened to veto this bill based on that feature alone.
   As recently as last summer at a Finance Committee hearing, his own CMS Administrator, Mark McClellan, stated - and this is a quote from the Bush administration: ""Extending coverage to parents and caretaker relatives"" - parents and caretaker relatives - ""not only serves to cover additional insured individuals, but may also increase the likelihood that they will take the steps necessary to enroll their children. Extending coverage to parents and caretakers may also increase the likelihood that their children remain enrolled in CHIP.""
   Here is a copy of a letter that Administrator McClellan wrote to my home State of Rhode Island on January 13, 2006. It reads: ""We are pleased to inform you that your amendment to the RiteCare section 1115 demonstration, as modified by the special terms and conditions accompanying this award, has been approved."" 
   It also notes that Rhode Island's request to renew its demonstration project has also been approved.
   And what exactly did Mark McClellan approve? Here is the next quote: ""Expenditures for expanded SCHIP eligibility to individuals who, at the time of initial application, are custodial parents or relative caretakers of children eligible under the plan."" 
   Signed Dr. Mark McClellan.
   The Bush administration approved the program in Rhode Island for custodial parents and relative caretakers. Yet the President is shocked - shocked - that this program may cover some adults.
   President Bush: You authorized the coverage for these adults over and over, State by State, through your Cabinet Secretary overseeing this problem. Your argument, sir, is with yourself.
   All I can say is you were right the first time, before you took this shameful ideological U-turn.
   Setting aside reason, setting aside the security and peace of mind of countless working-class families, driven by ideology, President Bush lifted his veto pen for only the fourth time in his Presidency and struck down the Children's Health Insurance Program. His reason this
  week: Because it costs too much.
   In other words, the same administration that in 1 year, in 2008, will spend $70 billion to pay for the Bush tax cuts for the top 1 percent of income earners, thinks it is too much to spend half that much over 5 years to provide billions of American children affordable health care. Said another way, the annual cost of Bush tax cuts for the superrich is 10 times the annual cost of this bill for children's health care, and he says he vetoes it over its cost.
   The same administration is spending more than $10 billion each month in Iraq, with no plan for ending the war and bringing our troops home, an administration that is now asking for 200 billion more dollars for the war this coming year, refuses to spend $35 billion over the next 5 years to provide millions of children all over this country affordable health care.
   Instead, the President sought a funding level that would result in 1 million American children losing - losing - their health insurance.
   So where would their families go to get these children health care if they don't have access to this insurance under the President's proposal? Well, before an audience in Cleveland on July 10, the President of the United States revealed his approach: ""People have access to health care in America,"" he said. ""After all, you just go to an emergency room."" 
   So that is it.
   Tax cuts for billionaires that explode our national debt and leave future generations on the hook to pay for it - that is a big priority for President Bush. Billions for Blackwater, for an endless war with no plan to end it, for no-bid contracts for Halliburton - that is a big priority for President Bush.
   But health care for children and their struggling working-class families, all paid for in the budget after hard-working bipartisan compromise? Nope. That is not a priority. That is a veto.
   And the kids? ""Send them to the emergency room,"" he says.
   I am ashamed of the President's decision. His veto was unnecessary. It was wrong. It is now up to Congress to make it right. I ask my colleagues to override the President's veto of children's health insurance.

  The Senate late last night unanimously passed a resolution cosponsored by Senator Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), urging the Secretary of Commerce to reconsider a previous decision and declare a commercial fishery failure for groundfish fishermen in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire. This action will help provide immediate disaster assistance to the region. Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.) sponsored the resolution; Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), and John Sununu (R-N.H.) also cosponsored. 
  ""The fishing industry is vital to Rhode Island's economy, and I am pleased that the Senate has passed this important resolution. At a time when it is costing our fishermen more to fuel up their boats and regulations are limiting their catches, we need to provide our fisherman with some measure of relief,"" said Senator Jack Reed. ""The Bush Administration should reverse course and provide federal assistance to Rhode Island fishermen.""
  ""I've talked with Rhode Island fishermen working hard to sustain their livelihoods and provide for their families,"" said Senator Whitehouse, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. ""In August, Senator Reed and I joined Rhode Island's congressional delegation to ask Secretary Gutierrez to take action to help our fishermen recover from this severe economic hardship. I strongly urge him to reconsider his decision to deny them this critical aid.""
  The Senate resolution (S. Res. 376), which passed the Senate by unanimous consent, noted that: ""Rhode Island has provided information to the Secretary of Commerce indicating that, since 1994, there has been a 66 percent drop in Rhode Island's groundfish fishery landings and, between 1995 and 2007, groundfish revenue decreased 20 percent from approximately $7,500,000 to $6,000,000.""
  It went on to note: ""Whereas the Secretary of Commerce rejected requests from Massachusetts, Maine, and Rhode Island to declare a commercial fishery failure prior to establishing any appropriate standard to implement section 312(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act; and 
  ""Whereas for centuries, growth in New England's commercial fishing industry has been intertwined with the history and economic growth of the New England States and has created thousands of jobs in both fishing and fishing-related industries for generations of New England residents: Now, therefore, be it 
   ""Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Commerce should-
   (1) Reconsider the October 22, 2007 decision to deny the requests of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the State of Maine, and the State of Rhode Island for a groundfish fishery failure declaration;
   (2) Look favorably upon the request of the State of New Hampshire for a groundfish fishery failure declaration; and
   (3) Immediately propose regulations to implement section 312(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1861a(a)).""

WHITEHOUSE SECURES PROTECTIONS FOR COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN BIPARTISAN GLOBAL WARMING BILL
  The Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee voted today to incorporate amendments sponsored by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), aimed at protecting coastal communities in Rhode Island and across the country, into a bipartisan bill to counter the impact of global warming. Whitehouse also successfully fought for provisions safeguarding wildlife and marine ecosystems.
  ""Rising temperatures around the globe could bring higher sea levels, more powerful storms, and increased risk of flooding and beachfront erosion. Global warming is real, and it has serious implications for the homes, businesses, communities, and ecosystems along our nation's coasts,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the EPW Committee. 
  ""Rhode Island has 400 miles of coastline, from South County's beaches to Newport Harbor to the Barrington and Seekonk Rivers. The amendments we passed today will help ensure that the people who live and work there have the information and resources they need to plan for the impact of climate change.""
  A study released yesterday by Environment Rhode Island found that global warming has contributed to an 88 percent increase in severe rainstorms, with heavy rainfall or snow, in Rhode Island over the past 60 years. The report noted that rising temperatures on land, in the oceans, and in the atmosphere cause water to evaporate more quickly and allow clouds to hold more water vapor, making this ""extreme precipitation"" more likely. Severe storms significantly increase the risk of flooding, water pollution, and other environmental damage, which would likely hit low-lying coastal areas in Rhode Island particularly hard. 
  The EPW Committee is considering the Climate Security Act (S. 2191), legislation sponsored by Senators Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) and John Warner (R-Va.) that would take steps to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 65 percent by 2050. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said that pollutant cuts in this range, if not higher, are necessary to avert the catastrophic effects of global warming. 
  To accomplish this, the bill would implement a ""cap-and-trade"" system in which most companies and organizations that emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide would be required to purchase ""emission allowances"" from the federal government. The facilities covered by this bill are responsible for more than 80% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The proceeds would support the development of renewable fuels, workforce training, environmental restoration, low-income energy assistance programs, and new energy technology.
  Whitehouse's amendments, adopted by the Committee today, would ensure that coastal communities affected by climate change have the information they need, such as data on projected sea level rise, severe weather, and associated flood risks, to prepare for and adapt to global warming, and that this data is considered and incorporated as part of any national plan to mitigate the effects of climate change. The amendments also would promote investment in renewable energy technologies and planning for the siting of wave energy, wind farm, and other clean energy facilities in states and coastal waters, including projects currently being considered in Rhode Island. 
  Whitehouse also worked with EPW Committee Chairman Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and the bill's sponsors to incorporate his Global Warming Wildlife Survival Act (S. 2204), which calls for a coordinated national strategy to help wildlife populations, habitats, and coastal and marine ecosystems adapt to stresses related to climate change.

  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), a member of the Senate Budget Committee, today issued the following statement on President Bush's FY2008 budget request:  
   ""The President's budget is unrealistic in its projections, irresponsible in its policymaking, and unfair in its effect on working families. President Bush demands hundreds of billions of dollars to finance an Iraq strategy his own military commanders have questioned, and his record defense budget requests offer no end in sight to his misguided policies abroad. 
   ""At home, beneath the rhetoric of fiscal discipline and hard choices lies a troubling reality, where working families shoulder the greatest burdens and are asked for the highest sacrifice. The Bush budget slashes funding for federal programs that help middle-class Americans afford health care, home heating oil, a college education, and food for their families, all to pay for massive tax giveaways to the wealthiest that deepen the deficit their enactment created. 
   ""The President's plan demands higher out-of-pocket health care payments from military retirees, veterans, and Medicare beneficiaries, and significant cuts in funding for critical health care initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) will put many low-income families in Rhode Island at risk of losing their health insurance. 
   ""While the Bush budget proposes increasing the maximum Pell Grant award, it would completely eliminate the federal Perkins loan and federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants for higher education. And with an overall 17.5 percent cut in funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), Rhode Island's share would likely drop $5.6 million from fiscal year 2006 levels. 
   ""This President's budget demands close scrutiny and tough questions. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Budget Committee and in the Senate as a whole to address our real priorities and put the country back on a more sustainable fiscal path.""

  ""Between work, picking kids up from school, and the thousand other things our families have to do every day, finding time to exercise can seem impossible - but it can be just as easy as taking the stairs or parking on the other side of the parking lot,"" Whitehouse said.

  Maria Montanaro, CEO of the Woonsocket-based community health center Thundermist, addressed the Senate Steering Committee on Telehealth and Healthcare Informatics today to discuss her organization's transition to electronic medical records. U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) introduced Montanaro at the event, titled ""HIT Projects to Improve Access for Low Income Persons and the Uninsured: Safety Net Providers Step up To the Plate."" 
   ""I think there is something truly inspiring about a safety net provider who defies the status quo, even in the face of terrible financial disincentives, to invest in state-of-the-art technology to provide the highest-quality care for those who have fallen through the cracks,"" said Whitehouse, an honorary co-chair of the steering committee. ""And Thundermist was careful to create their new infrastructure the right way - in cooperation with larger statewide projects in health information technology, advancing the goal of a statewide health information data exchange system.""
   Thundermist Health Center is a private, non-profit community health center (CHC) in Rhode Island that serves over 25,000 patients through more than 100,000 comprehensive primary health care visits a year in three communities -- Woonsocket, West Warwick, and South County. A 2007 study published in Health Affairs indicated that only 26 percent of CHCs reported some usage of electronic medical records, many citing lack of capital as a major barrier to adoption. Montanaro is leading Thundermist's transition from paper to electronic health records in order to better serve patients at its eight health center sites throughout Rhode Island.
   Last year, Whitehouse introduced legislation to establish a private, non-profit corporation tasked with developing a national, interoperable, secure health IT system (S. 1455). In January, he called on President George W. Bush to increase federal funding for health information technology in the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2009, to help speed the development of a national health IT system.

WHITEHOUSE RECEIVES SENATE 'GOLDEN GAVEL' AWARD
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) was presented with the Senate's ""Golden Gavel"" award today, commemorating 100 hours spent presiding over the Senate in the first session of the 110th Congress.  
  ""Presiding over the Senate is one of the great privileges afforded freshmen senators, and I've been excited to take every chance I could to learn more about this institution and my distinguished colleagues,"" Whitehouse said.
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said: ""Senator Whitehouse has truly earned this tremendous recognition. He has been a workhorse not only as the presiding officer - quickly logging 100 hours in that role - but on important legislation in the Judiciary Committee and this body as a whole. I'm certain this is only the first of many accolades Senator Whitehouse will collect during his Senate career.""
  In the past few decades, the task of presiding over the Senate has typically fallen to the Senate President pro tempore, usually the longest-serving member of the majority party. That senator often delegates the job to junior members, for whom presiding duties offer the opportunity to gain valuable experience and insight into Senate rules and procedure. The Golden Gavel award was instituted in the 1960s, and is given to senators who preside over 100 hours of Senate business in any single year.
  Whitehouse received the award at the weekly Democratic caucus luncheon. It was originally announced by Majority Leader Reid on the Senate floor on August 3rd, in the waning hours of debate before the Senate adjourned for its yearly August district work period.

  Emphasizing the importance of preserving Rhode Island's wilderness spaces, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) visited the Kettle Pond Visitor Center and Young Men's Christian Association Camp Watchaug this week to learn more about the sites and discuss ways to help them grow.  
   ""Our open spaces and our wilderness spaces are under more pressure than almost anywhere,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee. ""It merits, and will take, a significant effort to try to acquire as much property and as many conservation rights as we can."" 
   Kettle Pond Visitor Center, part of Ninigret National Wildlife Refuge, opened in fall 2005. The center is managed by Friends of the National Wildlife Refuges of Rhode Island, a nonprofit association devoted to the conservation and development of land and wildlife habitats at the state's five refuges. Other sites include Trustom Pond in South Kingstown, the only undeveloped coastal pond in the state; Sachuest Point in Middletown, home to the largest winter population of harlequin ducks on the Atlantic coast; the John H. Chafee National Wildlife Refuge at Pettaquamscutt Cove in Narragansett; and the Block Island National Wildlife Refuge. 
   30-acre YMCA Camp Watchaug opened in 1948 on the shore of Watchaug Pond and serves over a thousand campers each year. Whitehouse met with YMCA officials and local volunteers to discuss the camp's master plan, which envisions a series of major improvements to the facility to help it better meet the needs of the children it serves. 
   A proven and passionate fighter to protect our environment, as Rhode Island Attorney General Whitehouse argued before the U.S. Supreme Court to protect public wetlands from development, and sued to block Bush administration efforts to weaken the Clean Air Act. As the state's federal prosecutor, he led the investigation into a devastating oil spill in Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay, and made sure the fine - the largest in the state's history - was used for conservation. In 2003, Save the Bay gave Whitehouse its Environmental Advocacy Award.

WHITEHOUSE COSPONSORS AMENDMENT PROHIBITING TORTURE
  An amendment cosponsored by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) that effectively bans CIA interrogators from using torture has been adopted by the Congressional Intelligence Committees as part of an intelligence funding bill for 2008.  
  The measure, which would prohibit members of the intelligence community from using any interrogation technique beyond those authorized in the Army Field Manual, was sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and also cosponsored by Senators Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) and Russ Feingold (D-Wis.). Whitehouse and Feinstein had introduced a similar amendment earlier this year.
  ""By adopting this amendment, the two Intelligence Committees - Congress's experts on these matters - have sent a clear signal to America and to the world: that in this country the rule of law is our strongest bulwark against those who would do us harm,"" Whitehouse said. ""It is a signal that we expect our enemies to treat Americans humanely and with dignity, and we will do the same with them. And it signals our intent to restore America to its rightful place as the shining city on a hill; a beacon to other nations that reflects the hopes and aspirations of millions all over the world.""
  The amendment reads: ""No individual in the custody or under the effective control of an element of the intelligence community or instrumentality thereof, regardless of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to any treatment or technique of interrogation not authorized by the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations.""
  A number of military and civilian experts in interrogation have stressed that torture is ineffective in eliciting reliable intelligence. During an Intelligence Committee hearing in September, Colonel Steve Kleinman, a senior reserve intelligence officer with the Air Force Special Operations Command with 22 years of experience in interrogation, told Whitehouse that ""I've never felt any necessity or operational requirement to bring physical, psychological or emotional pressure on a source to win their cooperation.""
  In a May 2007 letter to troops serving in Iraq, General David Petraeus wrote that ""our experience in applying the interrogation standards laid out in the Army Field Manual (2-22.3) on Human Intelligence Collector Operations that was published last year shows that the techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in eliciting information from detainees.""

WHITEHOUSE CALLS FOR A NEW DIRECTION IN IRAQ
  In his first speech on the floor of the Senate, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) this evening called for a new direction in Iraq, sharply criticizing efforts to block the Senate's debate on the war and on measures demanding that the President change course. 
   Whitehouse's prepared remarks are below. 
   Remarks of United States Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI)  
  February 6, 2007 
  As Prepared for Delivery 
   Mr. President, I am dismayed at where we now stand. Last fall, the people of the United States sent a message to the President of the United States that the current course of his war in Iraq is deeply misguided, and that bold new solutions are called for. The President failed to listen. And yesterday, the Senate was prevented from speaking. 
   What we say here about our course in Iraq - and even more, what I hope we will soon do to correct that course - is among the most urgent concerns of the community of nations. It matters to millions of Americans who have already raised their voices in concern at a strategy lacking in foresight and cratered with flaws. It matters to millions more souls throughout the world whose lives, whose hopes, whose futures depend on American leadership and authority. 
   But we are silenced as a Senate, silenced because yesterday, on the single most important issue facing America today; on the issue that has cost more than three thousand young Americans their lives, tens of thousands more their limbs and livelihoods, and countless families their well-being; on the issue where this President has squandered so much of our national treasury and goodwill; the Senate was silent; silenced by parliamentary maneuver. 
   Mr. President, the people we represent deserve better from us. 
   As you know, Mr. President, I am new to this Body. But each time I step through those doors, I bring with me the hopes and expectations of thousands of Rhode Islanders I have heard who know it is time for a new direction in Iraq. Tired of a President who has failed to listen and failed to learn, last November they joined millions of their countrymen and voted for change. 
   Whenever I think of those men and women, I am filled with an enormous sense of responsibility. They trusted me to hear their voices, and to make sure the Senate hears them, too. So I speak today. I share Rhode Island's conviction that it is time for a change of course. Our troops and their families have made countless sacrifices, and our choices must be worthy of them. 
   The situation in Iraq is dire: rife with sectarian conflict that can only be resolved by Iraqi political cooperation, not by American military force. Mr. President, a broad consensus has emerged, from senior military commanders to the bipartisan Iraq Study Group and throughout the American people, that our best course would be to begin to redeploy American troops from Iraq. Instead, the President has insisted on a costly strategy of escalation that would send more of our soldiers into harm's way. I believe that is a terrible mistake. 
   It is my deeply-held conviction that in order to create the best environment for real change, the President must announce clearly and unequivocally that the United States plans to redeploy our troops from Iraq. That announcement would change the dynamic, enhancing our national security position in Iraq, the Middle East, and around the world, in three important ways. 
   First, a clear statement of American intent to redeploy forces from Iraq would eliminate the Iraqi insurgents' case that we are an army of occupation. The Iraqi population's nationalist sentiment would no longer be engaged against us. The Iraqi people don't want us there, and a majority of them consequently believe it is okay to kill American soldiers. 
   Second, without a buffering American presence, the world community would understand that it must face the consequences of the Iraq situation. Other nations in the region and elsewhere around the world would be motivated to take a more active role to work together to bring peace and stability to the region. Now, for all intents and purposes, we are alone. 
   In particular, Arab nations facing the risk of a pan-Arabic Sunni/Shiite conflict igniting in Iraq must then assume greater responsibility for averting such an outcome. Under current U.S. policy, these Arab countries have little incentive to help calm the conflict and reduce the violence. Any incentive they have is buffered by America's role as peacekeeper, and offset by the cost in many eyes of associating with the United States. 
   Third, Iran presently gains immensely from fomenting violence in Iraq. Keeping America bogged down in a civil war in Iraq undermines critical U.S. policy objectives, including the effort to work effectively with the international community to address the serious threat posed by Iran's nuclear program. The threat of American redeployment changes that calculation for Iran; the advantages Iran currently enjoys from bogging America down in Iraq would diminish or evaporate. 
   Some argue that to fail to support this President's judgment is to fail to support the troops. Never mind the manifest and repeated flaws in that judgment: misjudgment on weapons of mass destruction; misjudgment on when the mission was accomplished; misjudgment on the risks, costs, and demands of occupation; misjudgment on the wisdom of de-Baathification; misjudgment that the insurgency was in its ""last throes;"" misjudgment on whether there is civil war. There has never been a record of error, falsity, and failure like it. Now the unfortunate fact is that the President's bad misjudgments and failed diplomacy leave us few good options. 
   Changing the Iraq dynamic can set the stage for an aggressive international diplomatic effort to restore security in Iraq and combat terrorism worldwide. An intense diplomatic effort, with the parties thus motivated by the prospect of American redeployment, is our best remaining real chance for success. It will also staunch the hemorrhage of two critical American assets: our international standing and our national treasury. And most importantly, it will bring our troops home. 
   Without such a significant change in the dynamic, we are likely to remain trapped there, seen by many as more provocative than helpful, a great nation ensnared. For the safety of our troops, the stability of the region, and the security of our nation, that must not happen. 
   The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating. It undermines our national security by hurting our troops and their families, by diverting our attention from Al Qaeda and other critical threats, and by degrading our military capability for other actions. 
   The Iraq quagmire demands a new strategy that is both bold and realistic. If we lead boldly, sensitively, and firmly on the diplomatic front; if we speak again in realities instead of slogans; if we build consensus instead of polarizing nations - we can restore American prestige, leadership and goodwill. The President's escalation proposal does not help achieve these goals, and, yesterday, the Senate had the opportunity to say so. We did not. We were silenced, silenced by parliamentary maneuver. 
   The Senate has been called the world's greatest deliberative body. Let us deliberate. The debate over our course in Iraq echoes all over the world, from world capitals to the kitchen tables of Middle America - everywhere except this silenced Chamber. 
   Mr. President, I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to stop stalling and allow this body to deliberate. Ultimately, the free and unfettered clash of ideas that a real Senate debate represents: that is what our troops in Iraq are fighting to protect. 
   Let us not undermine their sacrifice with our silence. 
   For my part, it remains my view that announcing our intent to bring our soldiers home will help us start down the long road toward renewed American strength and leadership in the world. It is a critical journey, and it's long past time to begin.

  In the wake of tough questions from U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has announced new progress on regulations lifting the federal prohibition against electronic prescriptions for certain medications classified as scheduled drugs. In written responses to questions Whitehouse raised during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing he chaired in December, the agency said it had ""provided the Department of Justice with a proposed rule regarding the electronic prescribing of controlled substances.""  
   Whitehouse, a former prosecutor and strong advocate for health information technology, called the news ""encouraging"" but noted that the issue is far from settled. In its written response, DEA said it could not predict how long the approval process would take. Both the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of Justice are required to review the proposed rule. 
   ""E-prescribing for controlled substances is long overdue. With millions of Americans securely transmitting credit card and bank account information electronically, there's no reason a doctor shouldn't be able to prescribe Vicodin electronically,"" Whitehouse said. ""I'm glad to see DEA acknowledge the need to move forward with new rules, and I'll be watching closely over the next several months to make sure this process stays on track.""
   Studies show that widespread e-prescribing, used today in about 18 percent of doctors' practices, could save $20 billion annually, as patients would experience fewer adverse drug events (ADEs) and would be more likely to adhere to a medication regimen. The Center for Information Technology Leadership (CITL) found that a national e-prescribing system could prevent 2.1 million ADEs - 130,000 of which are life-threatening - and 190,000 hospitalizations per year.
   Current DEA regulations require that doctors write paper prescriptions for controlled substances, such as pain medications, antidepressants and some drugs used to treat asthma in children. As a result, many doctors resort to writing all their prescriptions by hand rather than maintain a paper system for controlled substances and an electronic system for non-controlled substances. 
   During the Judiciary Committee hearing, Whitehouse and Senator Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) pressed DEA Deputy Assistant Administrator Joseph T. Rannazzisi, of the Office of Diversion Control, on DEA's timeframe to revise the existing rules, stressing that further delay could slow the development and implementation of a nationwide, integrated system to support health information technology. ""You've seen intense bipartisan concern about this. This is not an issue where we're going to go away,"" Whitehouse said at the hearing. 
   Rannazzisi agreed to inform the Committee, within two months, on when a proposed rule would be issued. Following the hearing, Whitehouse and 18 other senators wrote to Attorney General Michael Mukasey, asking him to review the issue and urging the Drug Enforcement Administration to issue new rules promptly.
   Whitehouse served as U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island and the state's Attorney General. The founder of the Rhode Island Quality Institute, a leader in the state's efforts to promote electronic prescribing and health information technology utilization, Whitehouse has also introduced Senate legislation to establish a private, non-profit corporation tasked with developing a national, interoperable, secure health IT system (S. 1455).

REED, WHITEHOUSE ANNOUNCE
  The Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee has approved legislation that will make it easier for the University of Rhode Island Transportation Center (URITC) to receive critically-needed federal funding, Rhode Island's U.S. Senators announced today. 
  Established in 1999, URITC conducts multi-disciplinary education, research, technology transfer, and outreach for surface transportation systems and advanced transportation infrastructure. Under its original authorization, the center received an average of $1.6 million in federal funding, which it was required to match. When URITC was reauthorized in 2003 by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA), it was assigned a different designation and now receives $500,000, but current law still forces the center to continue to provide $1.6 million in matching funds in order to receive its federal award. 
  Rhode Island Senators Jack Reed (D) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D) wrote in April to Senators Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), the chairman and ranking member of the EPW committee, asking for a technical correction that would require centers like URITC to be required to match only the amount of the award provided under SAFETEA. Whitehouse serves on the EPW Committee, which today voted to approve legislation that includes this technical fix for URITC. The measure now goes before the full Senate.
  ""URI's Transportation Center is a leader in research and training students to work with new transportation technologies,"" said Senator Reed. ""I am pleased the committee approved this measure to provide URI with greater flexibility over its finances. I applaud Senator Whitehouse for passing this initiative through the Environment and Public Works Committee and will work with him to ensure it becomes law.""
  ""From the new Jamestown bridge to the relocation of I-195, Rhode Islanders can see our transportation system at work - and we're proud that URITC is helping to make that system work better,"" Senator Whitehouse said. ""I will continue to work with my senior senator, Jack Reed, to ensure that a technicality doesn't stand in the way."".

  Improved health information technology, including better-integrated records for service members returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan, won inclusion in the Senate's budget resolution today with the passage of a bipartisan amendment sponsored by U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). The measure, which creates a reserve fund supporting widespread adoption of health information technology and accepted best practices in clinical settings, was cosponsored by Senators Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and Mike Enzi (R-WY).
   Whitehouse, a member of the Budget Committee who has introduced major health IT legislation, praised the Committee's vote. ""Health information technology cuts costs and saves lives - but we're not investing enough to realize those extraordinary benefits,"" Whitehouse said. ""I hope making health IT - especially initiatives supporting the young men and women now returning from war - a priority in our budget will help encourage greater investments and speedier reforms."" 
   A fully-interoperable, nationwide health information infrastructure could drastically improve patient care, by giving doctors on-the-spot information and data to support diagnoses and other decisions; preventing avoidable medical errors; connecting doctors, pharmacies, and hospitals to allow medical records to be transferred electronically; and allowing health care facilities to track inpatients' recovery progress. A 2005 study by the RAND Corporation found that health IT implementation could save more than $81 billion annually, largely in shorter hospital stays, more effective drug usage, and reduced time spent on paperwork.
   Despite the potential benefits, a lack of investment has slowed progress towards a nationwide, interoperable health IT system. As of 2005, total public investment per capita in health IT in the U.S. was only 43 cents, compared to $192.79 in the United Kingdom, according to the Commonwealth Fund. Because the costs of implementing health IT are often overwhelming for providers, who likely will not receive most of the savings associated with the new system, experts agree that public funding is critical in encouraging broader health IT adoption. The American Hospital Association reported that only 11 percent of community hospitals had fully adopted electronic health records in 2006, and a study published in Health Affairs found that only 13 percent of community health centers met even the most minimal standards for electronic health record functionality in 2007.
   The Stabenow-Whitehouse amendment creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund to accommodate legislation that provides incentives or other support for adoption of modern information technology to improve quality and protect privacy in health care, or for payments that are based on adherence to accepted clinical protocols identified as best practices. Reserve funds allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to adjust the budget resolution when certain legislation is passed, to accommodate revenue and spending levels included in the new legislation. Whitehouse and Stabenow successfully passed a similar amendment during last year's budget debate.
   The measure also places special emphasis on efforts now underway by the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration to create seamless, interoperable electronic health records for service members transitioning from active duty service to veteran status. For military members returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, particularly those who are severely wounded, this system ensures that critical diagnostic and treatment information is available, improving the quality of care available to America's warriors. Singling this initiative out in the budget resolution will make it clear that better health IT for service members and veterans is a key priority in this Congress.
   The founder of the Rhode Island Quality Institute, a leader in the state's efforts to improve health care quality and health information technology utilization, Whitehouse has introduced Senate legislation to establish a private, non-profit corporation tasked with developing a national, interoperable, secure health IT system (S. 1455).

  The budget resolution passed today by the Senate Budget Committee will increase funding for veterans, schools, and transportation infrastructure and provide for a second economic stimulus package to help working families facing continued financial hardship, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said today. Whitehouse, a member of the panel, voted to approve the measure, an annual resolution setting funding parameters and priorities for the federal government that was reported to the full Senate this afternoon.
   ""Over and over again, President Bush and the Republicans have chosen tax cuts for millionaires and an endless war in Iraq over our children, our veterans, our infrastructure, and our struggling middle-class families,"" Whitehouse said. ""This budget makes a different choice - the right choice - and puts Rhode Island's priorities first."" 
   As approved by the committee, the budget sets aside $35 billion for stimulus legislation, which may include aid to states, extended unemployment benefits, and food stamp and LIHEAP funding. It also raises funding for education and training by $8.8 billion above the President's request for 2009, and, due in part to a request by Whitehouse for increased funding for middle schools, triples funds for a program strengthening middle- and high-school reading skills.
   Continuing this Congress's strong record of support for veterans, the Senate Budget Committee's resolution provides $3.2 billion above President Bush's request for veterans' benefits and programs, and rejects the President's proposal to raise fees on prescription drugs, VA enrollment, and insurance. It increases infrastructure investments in 2009 by $9 billion more than the President requested, and adds $3.5 billion for stimulus spending on ready-to-go projects.
   The committee also passed two amendments sponsored by Whitehouse aimed at prioritizing health information technology and protections for oceans and coastal areas. ""Rhode Island is a nationally- recognized leader in health information technology implementation, and our concern for our precious marine and coastal ecosystems is second to none,"" said Whitehouse. ""I'm glad the Budget Committee approved these two amendments, and will work to make certain they are both included in Congress's final budget.""

   A fully-interoperable, nationwide health information infrastructure could drastically improve patient care, and a study by the RAND Corporation found that effective implementation of health information technology could save more than $81 billion annually. But despite the potential benefits, a lack of investment has slowed progress towards a nationwide, interoperable health IT system.

In January, he wrote to President Bush asking for an increase in federal funding for health information technology in the administration's budget proposal.
   Protecting Our Oceans and Coastal Areas
   America's oceans, lakes, and coasts face significant threats from pollution, the collapse of fishing stocks, the disappearance of irreplaceable marine habitats, and global climate change. Increased federal support for oceans and coasts could help clean up pollution, implement sustainable fishery management policies, and ameliorate the long-term effects of global warming.
   Whitehouse's amendment would incorporate protections for oceans and coastal areas, including the Great Lakes, into a deficit-neutral reserve fund, which supports increased investment in clean, renewable energy, green jobs, and environmental preservation, in the underlying budget resolution. Reserve funds allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to adjust the budget resolution when certain legislation is passed, to accommodate revenue and spending levels included in the new bill.
   Last year, Whitehouse introduced the Global Warming Wildlife Survival Act (S. 2204), which calls for a coordinated national strategy to help wildlife populations and habitats, including coastal and marine animals and ecosystems, adapt to stresses related to climate change. The bill was incorporated into the Climate Security Act (S. 2191), which passed the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee in December and now awaits consideration by the full Senate. Whitehouse serves on the EPW Committee. Whitehouse alsooffered an amendment to the Climate Security Act, which passed, that would ensure that coastal and Great Lakes communities affected by climate change have the information they need, such as data on projected sea level rise, severe weather, and associated flood risks, to prepare for and adapt to global warming.

  The Senate Budget Committee today unanimously passed an amendment sponsored by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) to support investments in America's oceans and coasts as part of the Senate's proposed FY 2009 budget resolution. 
   ""For us in the Ocean State, protecting our marine and coastal ecosystems isn't just a priority - it's a mission,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the budget panel who also sits on the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee. ""We need to do more to ensure that these precious resources last for generations.""
   America's oceans, lakes, and coasts face significant threats from pollution, the collapse of fishing stocks, the disappearance of irreplaceable marine habitats, and global climate change. Pollution from many different sources - overburdened sewage treatment plants, agricultural and residential runoff, marine vessel discharges, and airborne sources from power plants - endangers marine species and contaminates coastal waters and beaches. Global climate change represents one of the most severe and growing threats, and Rhode Island has already begun to experience a significant ecosystem shift within Narragansett Bay as the water's temperature gradually warms. Warmer water contributed to a massive fish kill in Greenwich Bay in the summer of 2003.
   The Joint Oceans Commission has written: ""Our failure to properly manage the human activities that adversely affect our oceans and coasts is compromising the health of these systems and diminishing our ability to fully realize their potential."" Increased federal support for oceans and coastal areas could help clean up pollution, implement sustainable fishery management policies, and help oceans adapt to the long-term effects of global warming.
   Whitehouse's amendment would incorporate protections for oceans and coastal areas, including the Great Lakes, into a deficit-neutral reserve fund, which supports increased investment in clean, renewable energy, green jobs, and environmental preservation, in the underlying budget resolution. Reserve funds allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to adjust the budget resolution when certain legislation is passed, to accommodate revenue and spending levels included in the new legislation.
   Last year, Whitehouse introduced the Global Warming Wildlife Survival Act (S. 2204), which calls for a coordinated national strategy to help wildlife populations and habitats, including coastal and marine animals and ecosystems, adapt to stresses related to climate change. The bill was incorporated into the Climate Security Act (S. 2191), which passed the EPW Committee in December and now awaits consideration by the full Senate. Whitehouse also offered an amendment to the Climate Security Act, which passed, that would ensure that coastal and Great Lakes communities affected by climate change have the information they need, such as data on projected sea level rise, severe weather, and associated flood risks, to prepare for and adapt to global warming.

  In an effort to protect the health and well being of Rhode Islanders and redevelop former industrial sites, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse today announced $1.6 million to help clean up brownfields in communities across the state. A brownfield site is property where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. Woonsocket, Providence Community Health Centers, Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), Middletown, and Richmond will receive these competitive brownfields awards.
   ""Rhode Island's rich industrial past contributed significantly to our state culture and economy. Brownfields are a legacy of our industrial heritage and this critical federal funding will go a long way toward revitalizing these sites in our communities and restoring them to productive use,"" said Reed, a member of the appropriations subcommittee that oversees federal funding for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) programs. In 2002 Senator Reed helped pass legislation that made this federal funding possible. He also chairs the Northeast Midwest Coalition, which has made brownfield cleanup and redevelopment a priority. ""Not only will this federal investment help protect the health and well being of residents and the environment, but it will generate job growth, increase surrounding property values, and strengthen the local economy."" 
   The Brownfields Program, administered by the EPA, empowers states, communities, and other stakeholders to work together to prevent, assess, safely clean up, and sustainably reuse brownfield sites.
   ""Brownfields grants help clean up heavily polluted former industrial sites that put our environment and public health at risk. Without proper clean-up these lands would be unusable for hundreds or even thousands of years,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee. ""Reclaimed brownfields can become new locations for businesses, parks and open spaces, or schools. I'm glad that Rhode Island has received this federal support to continue our work to make our state a healthier, greener environment for our families.""
   The city of Woonsocket will receive $600,000 to clean up the former FDS Industries site at 138 Hamlet Avenue, the former ACS Industries site at 71 Villa Nova Street, and the former Florence Dye Works site at 168 Florence Drive. Grant funds will be used to remove and treat contaminated materials, install caps on the sites, and conduct ongoing monitoring activities. Cleanup of the sites is part of a plan underway to redevelop the area into a new educational campus. Once the sites are cleaned up, the city plans to construct two new, state-of-the-art middle schools to replace its existing one. This redevelopment project is expected to improve the city's public school system, attract private investment to the community, and increase surrounding property values. 
  Providence Community Health Centers will receive $400,000 to clean up Buildings #1 and #2 and the parking lot of the Beaman and Smith Factory Complex at 20 Gordon Avenue. Grant funds will be used to remove and dispose of contaminated soil, conduct groundwater monitoring, and support community involvement activities. Once the sites are cleaned up, they will become part of a state-of-the-art urban industrial park that is expected to provide health care services, commercial and retail operations, and greenspace, as well as create 1,850 sustainable jobs for local residents. This redevelopment is expected to serve as a catalyst for broader economic development.
   Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management will receive $400,000 to conduct two Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessments in a seven-community target area. These communities include Warwick, Coventry, West Warwick, Cranston, Woonsocket, Pawtucket, and Central Falls. Brownfields assessment will help the state and local communities gain information about real and perceived environmental contamina?tion at sites and leverage resources for redevelop?ment.
   The town of Middletown will receive $200,000 to clean up the 33.3-acre Town Center in the Valley site located at the southeast corner of High Street and O'Neill Boulevard in central Middletown. Grant funds also will be used to conduct community involvement activities. Once it is cleaned up, the town plans to redevelop it into a neighborhood park with walking paths, picnic areas, and a wildlife habitat. Development of the park is expected to increase surrounding property values.
   The town of Richmond will receive $200,000 to clean up the 0.6-acre former Knowles Mill site at 5 Railroad Street in Shannock Village. Grant funds will also be used to support community involvement activities. When the site is cleaned up, the town plans to redevelop it as a public park with a recreational area and interpretive information about the industrial and Native American histories of the site, surrounding area, and Pawcatuck River. Cleanup and redevelop?ment of the site are expected to preserve the historic landscape.

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, delivered the following remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate today:
  We will shortly consider making right the things that are wrong with the so-called Protect America Act, a second-rate piece of legislation passed in a stampede in August at the behest of the Bush Administration. It is worth for a moment considering why making this right is so important.
  President Bush pressed this legislation not only to establish how our government can spy on foreign agents, but how his administration can spy on Americans. Make no mistake, the legislation we passed in August is significantly about spying on Americans - a business this administration should not be allowed to get into except under the closest supervision. We have a plain and tested device for keeping tabs on the government when it's keeping tabs on Americans. It is our Constitution. 
  Our Constitution has as its most elemental provision the separation of governmental powers into three separate branches. When the government feels it necessary to spy on its own citizens, each branch has a role.
  The executive branch executes the laws, and conducts surveillance. The legislative branch sets the boundaries that protect Americans from improper government surveillance. The judicial branch oversees whether the government has followed the Constitution and the laws that protect U.S. citizens from violations of their privacy and their civil rights.
  It sounds basic, but even an elementary understanding of this balance of powers eludes the Bush administration. So now we have to repair this flawed and shoddy ""Protect America Act."" 
  Why are we in Congress so concerned about this? Why is it so vital that we energetically assert the role of Congress and the Courts when the Bush Administration seeks to spy on Americans? 
  Because look what the Bush Administration does behind our backs when they think no one is looking.
  For years under the Bush Administration, the Office of Legal Counsel within the Department of Justice has issued highly classified secret legal opinions related to surveillance. This is an administration that hates answering to an American court, that wants to grade its own papers, and OLC is the inside place the administration goes to get legal support for its spying program. 
  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I was given access to those opinions, and spent hours poring over them. Sitting in that secure room, as a lawyer, as a former U.S. Attorney, legal counsel to Rhode Island's Governor, and State Attorney General, I was increasingly dismayed and amazed as I read on.
  To give you an example of what I read, I have gotten three legal propositions from these OLC opinions declassified. Here they are, as accurately as my note taking could reproduce them from the classified documents. Listen for yourself. I will read all three, and then discuss each one.
  1. An executive order cannot limit a President. There is no constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order. Rather than violate an executive order, the President has instead modified or waived it.
   2. The President, exercising his constitutional authority under Article II, can determine whether an action is a lawful exercise of the President's authority under Article II.
   3. The Department of Justice is bound by the President's legal determinations. 
  Let's start with number one. Bear in mind that the so-called Protect America Act that was stampeded through this great body in August provides no - zero - statutory protections for Americans traveling abroad from government wiretapping. None if you're a businesswoman traveling on business overseas, none if you're a father taking the kids to the Caribbean, none if you're visiting uncles or aunts in Italy or Ireland, none even if you're a soldier in the uniform of the United States posted overseas. The Bush Administration provided in that hastily-passed law no statutory restrictions on their ability to wiretap you at will, to tap your cell phone, your e-mail, whatever.
  The only restriction is an executive order called 12333, which limits executive branch surveillance to Americans who the Attorney General determines to be agents of a foreign power. That's what the executive order says.
  But what does this administration say about executive orders?
  An executive order cannot limit a President. There is no constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order. Rather than violate an executive order, the President has instead modified or waived it.
  ""Whenever (the President) wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order,"" he may do so because ""an executive order cannot limit a President."" And he doesn't have to change the executive order, or give notice that he's violating it, because by ""depart(ing) from the executive order,"" the President ""has instead modified or waived it."" 
   So unless Congress acts, here is what legally prevents this President from wiretapping Americans traveling abroad at will: nothing. Nothing.
  That was among the most egregious flaws in the bill passed during the August stampede they orchestrated by the Bush Administration - and this OLC opinion shows why we need to correct it.
  Here's number two. 
   The President, exercising his constitutional authority under Article II, can determine whether an action is a lawful exercise of the President's authority under Article II.
  Yes, that's right. The President, according to the George W. Bush OLC, has Article II power to determine what the scope of his Article II powers are.
  Never mind a little decision called Marbury v. Madison, written by Chief Justice John Marshall in 1803, establishing the proposition that it is ""emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is."" Does this administration agree that it is emphatically the province and the duty of the judicial department to say what the President's authority is under Article II? No, it is the President, according to this OLC, who decides the legal limits of his own Article II power. 
  The question ""whether an action is a lawful exercise of the President's authority under Article II,"" is to be determined by the President's minions, ""exercising his constitutional authority under Article II.""
  It really makes you wonder, who are these people? They have got to be smart people to get there. How can people who are so smart be so misguided?
  And then, it gets worse. Remember point three. 
  The Department of Justice is bound by the President's legal determinations. 
  Let that sink in a minute. 
  The Department of Justice is bound by the President's legal determinations.
  We are a nation of laws, not of men. This nation was founded in rejection of the royalist principles that ""l'etat c'est moi"" and ""The King can do no wrong."" Our Attorney General swears an oath to defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States; we are not some banana republic in which the officials all have to kowtow to the ""supreme leader."" Imagine a general counsel to a major U.S. corporation telling his board of directors, ""in this company the counsel's office is bound by the CEO's legal determinations."" The board ought to throw that lawyer out - it's malpractice, probably even unethical. 
  Wherever you are, if you are watching this, do me a favor. The next time you are in Washington, D.C., take a taxi some evening to the Department of Justice. Stand outside, and look up at that building shining against the starry night. Look at the sign outside- ""The United States Department of Justice."" Think of the heroes who have served there, and the battles fought. Think of the late nights, the brave decisions, the hard work of advancing and protecting our democracy that has been done in those halls. Think about how that all makes you feel.
  Then think about this statement:
   The Department of Justice is bound by the President's legal determinations.
  If you don't feel a difference from what you were feeling a moment ago, well, congratulations - there is probably a job for you in the Bush administration. Consider the sad irony that this theory was crafted in that very building, by the George W. Bush Office of Legal Counsel.
  In a nutshell, these three Bush administration legal propositions boil down to this:
  1. ""I don't have to follow my own rules, and I don't have to tell you when I'm breaking them.""
  2. ""I get to determine what my own powers are.""
  3. ""The Department of Justice doesn't tell me what the law is, I tell the Department of Justice what the law is.""
  When the Congress of the United States is willing to roll over for an unprincipled President, this is where you end up. We should not even be having this discussion. But here we are. I implore my colleagues: reject these feverish legal theories. I understand political loyalty, trust me, I do. But let us also be loyal to this great institution we serve in the legislative branch of our government. Let us also be loyal to the Constitution we took an oath to defend, from enemies foreign and domestic. And let us be loyal to the American people who live each day under our Constitution's principles and protections.
  We simply cannot put the authority to wiretap Americans, whenever they step outside America's boundaries, under the exclusive control and supervision of the executive branch. We do not allow it when Americans are here at home; we should not allow it when they travel abroad. The principles of congressional legislation and oversight, and of judicial approval and review, are simple and longstanding. Americans deserve this protection wherever on God's green earth they may travel.

LEAHY, WHITEHOUSE URGE ATTORNEY GENERAL MUKASEY TO CLARIFY TESTIMONY ABOUT DESTRUCTION OF CIA TAPES
  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who also sits on the panel, sent a letter Thursday urging Attorney General Michael Mukasey to clarify testimony given to the Committee during last week's Department of Justice oversight hearing. In the letter, they ask the Attorney General to explain the scope of the Department's investigation into the CIA's destruction of videotapes showing the use of harsh interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, of al Qaeda terrorist suspects.
   Attorney General Mukasey has appointed John Durham, a federal prosecutor from Connecticut, to head an investigation into the destruction of the tapes. During a Jan. 30 hearing, the Attorney General testified that the scope of the Department's investigation could include any illegal conduct shown on the tapes. However, a Justice Department spokesman told The Washington Post following the hearing that nothing in the Attorney General's testimony suggested that nobody who ""relied in good faith upon the Department's advice would be subject to criminal investigation."" 
   ""In contrast to your testimony that the investigation would go where it leads and could include the conduct on the tapes if warranted, the [Brian] Roehrkasse statement appears to foreclose any possibility of investigating whether actions recorded on the tapes evidence illegal conduct,"" Leahy and Whitehouse wrote. ""If the Department of Justice has determined as a matter of policy that irrespective of evidence it will never investigate possible conduct in violation of legal prohibitions against torture, you should clarify your testimony to the Committee by disclosing that determination.""
   Leahy and Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) sent a letter Dec. 10 asking the Attorney General to provide an account of the Justice Department's role in destruction of the tapes, as well as any advice the Department had given on the legality of techniques used in the interrogations.
  Mukasey is scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee today. 
   The text of the letter follows. A PDF is available upon request.
   February 7, 2008
   The Honorable Michael B. Mukasey
  Attorney General of the United States
  U.S. Department of Justice
  950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
  Washington, DC 20530
   Dear Attorney General Mukasey:
   We seek clarification from you after a statement made by the Department's spokesman following last week's oversight hearing that appears to contradict your testimony. 
   You were asked at the hearing about the scope of the Department's investigation into the CIA's destruction of videotapes showing its officers using harsh interrogation techniques, reportedly including waterboarding. Director Hayden of the CIA confirmed publicly this week that the CIA has used waterboarding. 
  In response to our questions about whether the investigation being conducted by acting U.S. Attorney John Durham would include not just the tapes' destruction, but also any illegal conduct shown on those tapes, you appeared to testify that it could. Your testimony was contradicted immediately after the hearing when, as reported in The Washington Post, Brian Roehrkasse, the Department's spokesman, said that nothing in your testimony ""suggests that any of those who relied in good faith upon the Department's advice would be subject to criminal investigation."" 
  In contrast to your testimony that the investigation would go where it leads and could include the conduct on the tapes if warranted, the Roehrkasse statement appears to foreclose any possibility of investigating whether actions recorded on the tapes evidence illegal conduct. If the Department of Justice has determined as a matter of policy that irrespective of evidence it will never investigate possible conduct in violation of legal prohibitions against torture, you should clarify your testimony to the Committee by disclosing that determination. 
  The Department's statement also heightens our concern about possible conflicts within the Department that could unduly constrain Mr. Durham's investigation. Indeed, concern about the Department's role in offering advice on the legality or advisability of the destruction of the tapes as well as advice on the legality of techniques used in the interrogations led to the December 10, 2007 letter sent to you before the hearing that asked how the Department would resolve conflicts arising from such advice. These conflicts raise a question as to why you have not given Mr. Durham the ""plenary"" authority conferred on Patrick Fitzgerald by former Deputy Attorney General James Comey in the Plame investigation.
  In light of the contradictions and ambiguities exacerbated by the Department's statement following the hearing, we believe that it is important for you to clarify the scope of the Department's investigation, and make explicit any policy limitations you or others have imposed on the Department's exercise of its law enforcement duties. Specifically, is Mr. Durham authorized to include in his inquiry an investigation into whether the conduct that was shown on the destroyed tapes was illegal? What steps have you taken to make sure the investigation remains independent and fair? If Mr. Durham is foreclosed from investigating the conduct engaged in during the interrogations, how and by whom is he so foreclosed, how and by whom will determinations be made whether that conduct was in violation of law, taking into consideration the Department's ""advice""? How will the legitimacy and accuracy of the Department's ""advice"" be determined? 
   While we are sensitive to the need to avoid interfering with an ongoing criminal investigation, your testimony and the Department's subsequent statements have raised concerns that we hope you agree merit prompt response. 
   Sincerely,
   PATRICK LEAHY 
  Chairman

  The U.S. Senate today approved an economic stimulus package that extends financial assistance to over 20 million seniors living on Social Security. U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, had urged Senate leaders in a letter last month to include aid to seniors in legislation aimed at boosting the economy.  
   ""The Senate did the right thing today,"" Whitehouse said. ""In Rhode Island, too many seniors are struggling to make ends meet, trying to stretch Social Security checks to cover rising housing, prescription, and energy costs. This assistance won't solve those problems, but it will give older Americans a little help they desperately need.""
   More than 138,000 Rhode Islanders over the age of 65 received Social Security benefits in 2006, the last year for which data is available, with Social Security benefits averaging just $12,374 per year. Nationwide, 61 percent of seniors who receive Social Security benefits did not pay income taxes in 2006, a technicality that would have left them ineligible to receive aid under an earlier proposal negotiated between President Bush and the House of Representatives.
  The new compromise passed by the Senate today will provide a minimum $300 rebate to individual taxpayers ($600 for married taxpayers filing jointly) with at least $1 of tax liability or $3,000 in qualifying income. Unlike President Bush's plan, the Senate bill will count veterans' disability payments, including survivor payments, and Social Security benefits as income - ensuring that over 20 million seniors and 250,000 disabled veterans have access to this important financial support. 
  Last week, Whitehouse spoke on the Senate floor to renew his push for aid for seniors in the stimulus plan. ""Any rebate we're able to provide for seniors will provide just the kind of economic stimulus our country needs,"" he said in his speech. ""Older Americans are more likely to spend the money they receive and to spend it on the goods and services that will help our economy grow.""

WHITEHOUSE: PRESIDENT BUSH VETO OF TORTURE BAN ENDANGERS TROOPS, DAMAGES AMERICA'S MORAL STANDING
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and cosponsor of a measure that would ban the use of waterboarding and other extreme interrogation techniques by America's intelligence agencies, responded today to President Bush's announcement that he has vetoed the bill: 
   ""Unfortunately, President Bush has once again refused to send the clear message the world awaits that the United States of America does not torture.
   ""The House and Senate voted to ban the use of torture, a move publicly endorsed by at least 43 retired generals and admirals - one a former CIA Director - who know that when America tortures, it places our troops in danger and denigrates our most cherished values. Moreover, we have heard extensive testimony from interrogation experts that the Army Field Manual is effective in obtaining the information we need to keep this country safe.
   ""The President's claim that these techniques are 'not intended for intelligence professionals trained to question hardened terrorists' is false, and defames the experienced military interrogators who use these methods in vital national defense missions.
   ""The truth is: he simply won't admit when he is wrong, no matter what the cost.
   ""Vetoing this bill does great damage to our country, a nation that depends on its moral authority around the world, and it sends a troubling signal to our enemies about how they may treat Americans.
   ""Veto or not, let there be no mistake: neither Congress nor the American people will tolerate the use of torture by this government.""
   Whitehouse was the principal sponsor of an amendment prohibiting torture in July, as part of legislation authorizing funding and setting policy for the CIA and other branches of the intelligence community. When that amendment failed in the Senate Intelligence Committee, Whitehouse joined Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and several others to fight to add the amendment during House-Senate conference negotiations on the bill last December. That time, it passed.

  Congress today overrode President Bush's veto of legislation championed by U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) to support the restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems in Rhode Island and across the country. Today marks the first time Congress has overridden a veto by this President. 
  The Estuary Restoration Act (ERA) will now become law as part of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), a bipartisan measure originally passed in September. The Water Resources Development Act authorizes nearly $21 billion for essential flood control, navigation, and ecosystem restoration projects. 
  A member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, Whitehouse worked with Chairman Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) to ensure that the estuaries measure would be included in WRDA. Once the Senate passed the original legislation, Reed and Whitehouse also wrote to Boxer in early July to stress that the House-Senate conference committee's report on the final bill should preserve the estuary restoration program. 
  President Bush vetoed the Water Resources Development Act last week, claiming it ""lacks fiscal discipline.""
  ""President Bush wants hundreds of billions more for his misguided war in Iraq - but vetoes legislation providing just a fraction of that to help restore estuarine and coastal ecosystems in Rhode Island and many other states,"" Whitehouse said. ""Congress is fighting for Americans' real priorities, and today, our environment and our communities won. I'm proud that Congress has made this critical investment, and pleased to have worked with my senior senator, Jack Reed, to accomplish this."" 
  ""I am pleased that Congress, on a bipartisan basis, was able to override the President's veto,"" said Reed. ""I hope this bipartisan spirit can continue so that Congress can work together to get things done for the American people. We'll need this same spirit to overcome the President's misguided vetoes of the children's health bill and other veto threats on other important domestic issues."" 
   Estuaries like Narragansett Bay are essential to the health of coastal environments and economies, serving as natural barriers and helping insulate fragile ecosystems and coasts from flood waters. The serious threats of climate change and potential sea level rise underscore the importance of restoring estuarine habitats, which can make coastlines more resilient to storm surges. Estuary restoration benefits local economies, supporting recreational activities and preserving unique coastal cultures. At least 75 percent of commercially and recreationally valuable fish species spend part of their lives in estuaries and coastal wetlands.
   The ERA authorizes $2.5 million annually in dedicated funding for restoration projects whose federal funding share is less than $1 million. Four agencies, led by the Army Corps of Engineers, constitute the federal Estuary Restoration Interagency Council: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Resources Conservation Service. Past projects undertaken by the Interagency Council include restoration of salt marshes, mudflats, wetlands, and other important coastal ecologies.

WHITEHOUSE COMMENTS ON JUDGE MUKASEY CONFIRMATION VOTE
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island Attorney General, issued the following statement this evening on the Senate's vote on the nomination of Michael B. Mukasey to be Attorney General.  
  ""I voted against the nomination of Michael Mukasey because I believe this nation had the chance to present the world a moment of clarity on what we stand for. America's strength comes from its ideals. We do not - we cannot - stand for torture. And we cannot stand for an administration that cannot condemn torture. 
   ""I was deeply disappointed by Judge Mukasey's evasions on whether the practice of waterboarding is torture and unconstitutional. But this moment is now past. What is left is the hope that he will repair the damage his predecessor did to the Department of Justice, and the hope that if called upon to choose between obeying the President and upholding the rule of law, he will make the right choice. I hope we can trust this man for that.""

WHITEHOUSE MEETS HOPKINTON, WEST GREENWICH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) met Thursday with two high school students visiting Washington as part of their participation in the National Young Leaders Conference (NYLC). 
   Theresa Fuller of Hopkinton, a sophomore at Chariho Regional High School, and Geoffrey Swann of West Greenwich, a junior at Exeter West Greenwich High School, had been in Washington as part of their six-day program since Tuesday. The program is designed to give students a better understanding of their roles as citizens and leaders in a democracy. 
   ""Visiting Washington and speaking with me and their other representatives in Congress will, hopefully, develop a further interest in public affairs,"" said Whitehouse. ""I appreciate the efforts of these young Rhode Islanders to learn more about their government."" 
   The students had an opportunity to see Senator Whitehouse questioning Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson at a Budget Committee hearing, and shared their Washington site-seeing itinerary. 
   The NYLC program is sponsored by the Congressional Youth Leadership Council (CYLC), a non-partisan, non-profit educational organization. Since its inception in 1985, more than 200,000 young people have participated in CYLC's programs.

WHITEHOUSE PRAISES AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CLEAN AIR SETTLEMENT
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who as Rhode Island's Attorney General joined the 1999 federal lawsuit against American Electric Power (AEP), praised today's $4.6 billion settlement to require AEP to cut pollution at its 16 power plants. 
   ""This is an historic victory for clean air and the health and safety of the people of Rhode Island,"" Whitehouse said. ""I'm proud that Rhode Island was part of the original lawsuit against American Electric Power, brought during the Clinton administration. We joined that fight because it was the right thing to do for our state and our environment. This settlement will make a significant difference in emissions levels for years to come.""
   According to the Department of Justice, under the terms of the settlement AEP will be required to cut air pollution by at least 813,000 tons per year, including the installation of new emission control equipment. AEP will also pay a $15 million penalty, the highest paid by any electric utility in a settlement related to the Clean Air Act's New Source Review provision, and spend $60 million on environmental cleanup projects.
